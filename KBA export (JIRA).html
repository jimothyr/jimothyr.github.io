        <p>An ESCO&nbsp; is a company that offers energy services which may include implementing energy-efficiency
          projects (and also renewable energy projects) and in many case on a turn-key basis. The three main
          characteristics of an ESCO are:&nbsp;</p>

        <ul>
          <li>ESCOs guarantee energy savings and/or provision of the same level of energy service at lower cost. A
            performance guarantee can take several forms. It can revolve around the actual flow of energy savings from a
            project, can stipulate that the energy savings will be sufficient to repay monthly debt service costs, or
            that the same level of energy service is provided for less money.</li>
          <li>The remuneration of ESCOs is directly tied to the energy savings achieved;</li>
          <li>ESCOs can finance, or assist in arranging financing for the operation of an energy system by providing a
            savings guarantee.</li>
        </ul>

      </td>
      <td class="customfield_12982">
        <p><b>Derived from (E3P, 2016)</b></p>

        <p>ESCOs accept some degree of risk (varying according to the specific contract negotiated) for the achievement
          of improved energy efficiency in a user’s facility and have their payment for the services delivered based
          (either in whole or at least in part) on the achievement of those energy efficiency improvements.</p>

        <p>Another category of companies that offer energy services to final energy users, including the supply and
          installation of energy-efficient equipment, the supply of energy, and/or building refurbishment, maintenance
          and operation, facility management, and the supply of energy (including heat), are&nbsp;<b>Energy Service
            Provider Companies (ESPCs)</b><em>.</em>&nbsp;They may be consultants specialised in efficiency
          improvements, equipment manufacturers or utilities. ESPCs provide a service for a fixed fee or as added value
          to the supply of equipment. ESPC may have some incentives to reduce consumption, but these are not as clear as
          in the ESCO approach. Often the full cost of energy services is recovered in the fee, so the ESPC does not
          assume any risk in case of underperformance. EPSC is paid a fee for their advice or equipment rather than
          being paid based on the results of their recommendations.</p>

        <h3><a name="%C2%A0ESCOprojectelements"></a>&nbsp;ESCO project elements</h3>

        <p>The typical ESCO project includes the following elements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Site survey and preliminary evaluation;</li>
          <li>Investment grade energy audit;</li>
          <li>Identification of possible energy saving and efficiency improving actions;</li>
          <li>Guarantee of the results by proper contract clauses;</li>
          <li>Project financing;</li>
          <li>Comprehensive engineering and project design and specifications;</li>
          <li>Procurement and installation of equipment; final design and construction;</li>
          <li>Project management, commissioning and acceptance;</li>
          <li>Facility and equipment operation &amp; maintenance for the contract period;</li>
          <li>Purchase of fuel &amp; electricity (to provide heat, comfort, light, etc.);</li>
          <li>Measurement and verifications of the savings results;</li>
          <li>Operation and maintenance.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3><a name="InvestmentGradeAudit"></a>Investment Grade Audit</h3>

        <p>The Investment Grade Audit (IGA) deserves special attention. The traditional energy audit does not
          sufficiently consider how implemented measures will behave over time. An IGA builds on the conventional energy
          audit because auditors must consider the conditions under which measures will function during the life of the
          project. Unlike the traditional energy audit, which assumes that all conditions (related to e.g. system,
          payback, people) remain the same over time, IGA attempts to more accurately predict a building's future energy
          use by adding the dimension of a ‘risk assessment component’ which evaluates conditions in a specific building
          and/or processes. Aspect of the IGA, including risk management, the “people” factor, measurement and
          verification, financing issues, report presentation guidelines, and master planning strategies.</p>

        <p>An IGA should therefore serve as a financial investment guide as to how the physical assets of an
          organization can be improved.</p>

        <p>The Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme (PSDS) provides grants for public sector bodies to fund heat
          decarbonisation and energy efficiency measures.</p>

        <p>The PSDS is run as a series of phases with new applications to the first phase closing on 11 January 2021 and
          projects run until 30 September 2021. Phase 2 opened on 7 April 2021 and closed to applications on 13 April
          2021. The different phases have different focuses and available funds. Phase 1 made available £1 billion in
          grants as part of the Chancellor’s ‘Plan for Jobs 2020’ and phase 2 had a greater focus on decarbonisation of
          heat and provided £75 million.</p>

        <p>Phase 3 PSDS (now closed) aimed at taking a ‘whole building’ approach to heat decarbonisation, combining heat
          decarbonisation with energy efficiency measures</p>

        <p>Phases 1, 2 and 3 of the PSDS are managed by the BEIS delivery body Salix Finance.</p>

        <h3><a name="Eligibilitycriteria"></a>Eligibility criteria</h3>

        <p>The PSDS is open to a wide range of public sector bodies.</p>

        <p>Each phase has specific deadlines and projects must be submitted prior to the deadlines.</p>

        <p>There is no minimum or maximum grant value, and eligible bodies can apply for 100% funding.</p>

        <p>Any energy savings resulting from projects funded by the grant scheme should benefit the eligible body.
          Eligible technologies that do not have direct financial or carbon savings are exempt from this requirement.
        </p>

        <p>Salix will prioritise assessing and approving funding for projects that have an early completion date.
          Project delivery must then align with this completion date to remain compliant.</p>

        <p>There are 4 areas that are eligible &nbsp;(although may be phase dependent):</p>

        <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heat decarbonisation,</p>

        <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; energy reduction (BMS<span
            class="error">[\[HW2]</span>|]&nbsp;, cooling, improved-efficiency appliances, insulation, etc.),</p>

        <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heat decarbonisation enablers (storage, metering, etc.)</p>

        <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reducing higher carbon alternatives <span
            class="error">[\[HW3]</span>|]&nbsp;(such as coal).</p>

        <h3><a name="Furthercriteria"></a>Further criteria</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>The cost to save a tonne of carbon (CO₂e) over the lifetime of the project must be no more than £500.</li>
          <li>The grant scheme is primarily for capital works, but external consultancy and management fees may be
            included.</li>
          <li>The measures concerned are not required to be installed by law (including building or health and safety
            legislation).</li>
          <li>The measures are not being installed with a view to commercial gain (other than the reduction of costs
            through increased energy efficiency).</li>
          <li>Installation of the measures concerned have not begun.</li>
          <li>Funding for the project has not been agreed via another source.&nbsp;In general, however, in order to
            qualify for a Salix loan, a project must have a short payback period and represent good value for money in
            terms of carbon saving</li>

        <p>Once frameworks or Dynamic Purchasing Systems have been identified, via a framework search tool, or
          otherwise, there are a number of considerations before deciding whether the framework or DPS is suitable for
          your energy project.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="customfield_12982">
        <p> The following are important questions to try and answer:</p>



        <p><b>Does the&nbsp;framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS)&nbsp;scope cover&nbsp;your
            entire&nbsp;requirement?</b></p>

        <p>✅ Any framework or DPS will be limited in what services or products it can offer. Potential users should be
          clear about what they are looking to procure and be robust as to whether a chosen framework can provide it.
          There may be opportunities to change project scope or use multiple frameworks to deliver, although there are
          obviously project impacts of these choices.</p>

        <p><b>What is the framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) expiration&nbsp;date?</b></p>

        <p>✅ Frameworks have end dates. This is not quite so important with DPS as they may be self refreshing. Aligning
          a project procurement needs with the active period of a framework is vital. Risks of delays or slippage within
          the project should also be considered when assessing this.</p>

        <p><b>What are the call-off methods for the framework agreement in questions?</b></p>

        <p>✅ How can you use the framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS). Does the method of call off/
          mini tender/ selection align with your project timescales and needs.</p>

        <p><b>Who owns&nbsp;the&nbsp;framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS)&nbsp;and how&nbsp;robust
            are&nbsp;they?</b></p>

        <p>✅ Potential users should assess the framework owner (e.g. how financially robust are they (balance sheet)?).
          Who are they owned by? Do they have shareholders?)</p>

        <p><b>Do the&nbsp;framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS)&nbsp;terms and&nbsp;conditions
            allow&nbsp;you to contract&nbsp;in your&nbsp;preferred&nbsp;manner?</b></p>

        <p>✅ A local authority should consider things such as contract types available (Design and Build etc), the
          ability to incorporate finance from a contractor, or the ability to allow for innovation.</p>

        <p><b>What&nbsp;support&nbsp;will be&nbsp;provided?</b></p>

        <p>✅ How much of the procurement process is managed or supported by the framework operator? This may impact the
          capacity or capability required within the project team. It may also affect timescales for procurement. Does
          the framework provide support for building your evaluation criteria, for example.</p>

        <p><b>How well is&nbsp;the&nbsp;framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS)&nbsp;managed?</b></p>

        <p>✅ Some frameworks are owned but not managed. Those that are managed may be under capacity constraint. This
          may impact both procurement timelines and potentially quality of responses. (e.g. what support services are
          available? what processes are in place to manage and remove providers? what are the escalation procedures?)
        </p>

        <p><b>How much will&nbsp;the framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System
            (DPS)&nbsp;owner/support&nbsp;partner get paid&nbsp;either directly or&nbsp;indirectly for
            their&nbsp;support and use of&nbsp;the framework?</b></p>

        <p>✅ The cost of procurement will need to be included in the project budget.</p>

        <p><b>Is your&nbsp;selection of a&nbsp;framework/&nbsp;support partner&nbsp;compliant
            with&nbsp;public&nbsp;procurement&nbsp;rules?</b></p>

        <p>✅ Does the framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) align with public procurement rules. This
          should be the case as frameworks are set up to enable public procurement, but it is always better to be sure
          as the liability for breaking procurement rules may lie with the project procurement team.</p>

        <p><b>Is your&nbsp;selection of a&nbsp;framework/&nbsp;support partner&nbsp;compliant with your
            organisation's&nbsp;procurement&nbsp;rules?</b></p>

        <p>✅ Do your own procurement rules allow using a particular framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System
          (DPS)?</p>

        <p>In the majority of the existing examples, the authority selects up to five partners to participate in the
          Innovation Partnership. The authority pays a grant to contribute to their R&amp;D costs. At the end of the
          R&amp;D phase, the authority will then select its preferred solution(s)which may lead to a potentially
          lucrative contract for the selected supplier(s). However, there are other examples of authorities selecting
          only one partner to participate in the R&amp;D phase, or selecting a number of partners who are each allocated
          their own unique area to focus their R&amp;D efforts.</p>

          stages involved.&nbsp; </p>

            alt="" border="0"> Minimum requirements and the award criteria must not be negotiated.</p>

        <p>At the end of the process the solutions can be evaluated for further procurement options.</p>

        <h3><a name="Advertisingandrequesttoparticipate"></a>Advertising and request to participate</h3>

        <p>Any potential partners can submit a request to participate and answer the selection requirements. This does
          not mean they will be invited to submit projects.</p>

        <p>There must be a minimum of 30 days between the dispatch of the contract notice and the deadline for request
          to participate.</p>

        <h3><a name="Prequalification"></a>Pre-qualification</h3>

        <p>The potential partners submit prequalification and selection stage information as directed in the notice and
          documents.</p>

        <h3><a name="Selection"></a>Selection</h3>

        <p>The pre-qualification information is used by the contracting authority to establish whether the potential
          partners are qualified to perform the contract and to select those who are to be invited to tender.</p>

        <p>The evaluation of the selection stage information may be more challenging than other procedures. In
          particular, applying criteria concerning:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>the partner’s capacity in the field of research and development and</li>
          <li>of developing and implementing innovative solutions.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Innovation Partnership must be structured in successive phases to reflect the research and development
          stages involved.&nbsp; The structure, duration and value of the partnership’s different phases reflect the
          degree of innovation of the proposed solution and the sequence of the research and innovation activities.</p>

        <p>Intermediate targets and milestones must be set to be attained by the partners and provide for payment in
          appropriate instalments.</p>

        <p>Negotiations with partners over the initial and all subsequent tenders submitted are allowed to improve its
          content, except for the final tender. </p>

        <p>After each phase, the partnership can be ended or the number of partners reduced.&nbsp; Individual contracts
          can be terminated by applying the award criteria on the condition that this is stated in the procurement
          documents.</p>

        <p>Competitive dialogue is a specific legislative procurement route which allows departments (contracting
          authorities) to hold dialogue with bidders on various aspects of the procurement. Dialogue refers to the
          discussion between the department (contracting authorities) and bidder to discuss any aspect of the
          procurement, e.g. the service requirements or proposed solution.</p>

            alt="" border="0"> Under Public Contracts Regulations 2015 all competitions must be advertised publicly.
          This would usually be through standard procurement portals.</p>

        <p>A local authority “should publish their minimum requirements, award criteria and their weightings.&nbsp;
          These cannot be changed during the negotiation process. &nbsp;</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Any successive stages should be noted in the Contract Notice&nbsp;or descriptive document.</li>
          <li>At least 30 days must elapse before the closing date for receipt of selection stage information from the
            day after the Contract Notice is sent for publication.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>ℹ️ There are no further set minimum timescales for submissions beyond this stage, however timescale must be
          reasonable.&nbsp; Time limits must take account of the complexity of the contract and the time required for
          writing bids. The Contract Notice and/or a descriptive document must set out an indicative timeframe.</p>

        <h3><a name="Prequalification"></a>Pre-qualification</h3>

        <p>Potential bidders “submit prequalification and selection stage information.</p>

        <h3><a name="Selection"></a>Selection</h3>

        <p>The pre-qualification information supplied is used by the contracting authority to establish whether the
          potential bidders are qualified to perform the contract. This stage then selects those potential bidders that
          are to be invited to tender.</p>

        <h3><a name="Issuingofdialoguephasedocuments"></a>Issuing of dialogue phase documents</h3>

        <p>The local authority invites the selected candidates to participate in the dialogue, using an Invitation to
          take part in dialogue (ITPD)_. T_here is no minimum period specified for bids in response to this document but
          it must be reasonable.&nbsp;The number of suitable bidders who meet your selection criteria to be invited to
          participate in the procedure can be limited.&nbsp; </p>

        <p>At least three bidders should be invited to the dialog process (if 3 or more meet selection criteria) in
          order to ensure genuine competition.</p>

        <p>Bidders do not submit tenders before starting dialogues with the contracting authority.</p>

        <h3><a name="Initialtenderproposal"></a>Initial tender proposal</h3>

        <p>Initial proposals are received and the contracting authority enters into competitive dialogue phase with the
          shortlisted tenderers.</p>

        <h3><a
            name="CompetitiveDialogue%3ADiscussinganyaspectsoftheprocurement%2Ce.g.servicerequirements"></a>Competitive
          Dialogue: Discussing any aspects of the procurement, e.g. service requirements</h3>

        <p>Derived from (Supplier Journey, 2021)</p>

        <p>Following this initial response, there may be several stages of negotiations/dialogue in order to develop
          solutions and reduce the number of solutions (if indicated in the contract notice or the descriptive
          document).</p>

        <p>The number of stages is decided by the contracting authority, although it does have to set out in the
          contract notice or the descriptive document. If there are successive stages, there must enough solutions in
          the final stage to make for genuine competition.&nbsp; </p>

        <p>During the dialogue Organisations must ensure equal treatment of all participants.&nbsp;Any clarifications,
          specification, optimisation, additional information or negotiations must not involve changes to the essential
          aspects of the tender. &nbsp;</p>

        <p>All bidders must be informed when the dialogue is being concluded&nbsp;</p>

        <h3><a name="Finaltenderssubmission"></a>Final tenders submission</h3>

        <p>Potential suppliers submit tenders in response to the contracting authority’s advertised requirements.</p>

        <p>Each remaining bidder should submit their final tender on the basis of the solution(s) presented and
          specified during the dialogue.</p>

        <p>After the invitations to Submit Final Tenders&nbsp;are sent out, a deadline must be set for receipt of final
          tenders. There is no minimum period specified but these must be proportionate by taking into account the
          contract complexity and the time required to prepare and submit a bid.</p>

        <p>If there are significant changes made to the procurement documents or additional information is requested by
          a supplier you must extend the time limits for the receipt of tenders so that all bidders concerned are aware
          of all of the information needed to produce tenders at least 6 days before the time limit fixed for the
          receipt of tenders</p>

        <p>The length of extension must be proportionate to the importance of the information or change.</p>

        <p>Where possible all submissions should be made digitally, using open formats and platforms. Avoid requiring

        <p>(Derived from <em>Supplier Journey</em>, 2021)</p>

        <p>ℹ️ This is the only procedure where you are required to make the Invitation to Tender (ITT) available from
          the start of the procurement i.e. when the Contract Notice is published.</p>

        <p>If you decide to use an Open Procedure, you must provide full information about the requirements and
          qualitative selection process. The&nbsp;Invitation to Tender (ITT) documents&nbsp;must be issued to all
          bidders that request them.</p>

        <p>All Procurement Documents, including the ITT, must be made available:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>for free direct download</li>
          <li>from the internet</li>
          <li>from the time they are sent to participants in the process and</li>
          <li>with unrestricted access.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>


        <p>The Contract Notice must specify the internet address at which the Procurement Documents can be
          accessed.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>If exceptions apply, which mean the Procurement Documents are not available electronically, the Contract
          Notice must detail how access can be achieved.&nbsp; Timescales must be extended by five days if the documents
          cannot be accessed immediately by electronic means.&nbsp; An exception is &nbsp;in a case of a substantiated
          urgency.</p>

        <p>The Open Procedure allows for ITTs to be issued on request at any point prior to the date set for submission
          of tenders.</p>

        <p>When an ITT is issued near to the closing date, the recipient should be made aware that the submission date
          is imminent.</p>

        <p>You can clarify some aspects of the tender.&nbsp; You cannot clarify fundamental aspects where any changes
          may distort competition or cause discrimination. Any discussions you have with bidders should be properly
          recorded.&nbsp; Meetings which discuss proposals/requirements in any detail should be avoided as they
          &nbsp;&nbsp;may distort competition</p>

        <h3><a name="Finaltenderssubmission"></a>Final tenders submission</h3>

        <p>Potential suppliers submit both selection (qualification) information and tenders at the same time in
          response to the contracting authority’s advertised requirements.</p>

        <p>Where possible all submissions should be made digitally, using open formats and platforms. Avoid requiring
          multiple formats or needed to submit the same information in multiple files or formats. Any submission
          platform should allow the participant to review, amend and attach information for submission before the

        <p>The contracting authority may receive a large number of tenders; it cannot control the number of tenders that

          economic operators that have submitted the required documents and that meet the selection criteria are

        <p>Where the estimated earnings are under Thresholds then a private invitation procedure is allowed although
          rare. Where estimated earnings are above thresholds then Open Design Contests must be used with the design
          disciplines that a Local Authority is seeking made clear.</p>

            alt="" border="0"> Under Public Contracts Regulations 2015 all competitions must be advertised publicly.
          This would usually be through standard procurement portals.</p>

        <h3><a name="Prequalification"></a>Pre-qualification</h3>

        <p>Where a Design content is anticipated to attract a large number of entrants to be economic to assess a
          pre-selection stage can be used. Those looking to apply can be given the opportunity to submit a statement
          declaring their eligibility for shortlisting selection. </p>

        <p>This can help focus the submissions to those who have a clear chance of success and provide confidence that
          they wont get lost in the noise of too many participants. This can also help where the project budget is low,
          the project is high status or the sector is under economic stress.</p>

        <h3><a name="Selectionthroughshortlist"></a>Selection through shortlist</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>A design contest is carried out described for an open design contest, except that the shortlisting of
            candidates for the first stage is done by a selection.</li>
          <li>Local Authorities can determine in multiples of 35 upwards the maximum numbers they believe it is
            appropriate, equitable and economical to shortlist forward to make drawn submission_s._</li>
          <li>Applicants are able to submit their interest anonymously through a digital portal. They should submit a
            self certified declaration of eligibly. They will be issued a unique identifier. They can only submit once.
          </li>
          <li>The process is on hold until the applicants are shortlisted</li>
          <li>On the shortlisting date, the required number is randomly selected from the submissions to the number
            stated, if more than the desired number is received.</li>
          <li>The shortlist is then invited to progress and submit designs against the brief.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3><a name="IssueDesignContestBrief"></a>Issue Design Contest Brief</h3>

        <p>The design contest brief should be well written, unambiguous and as informative as possible clearly setting
          out the requirements but enabling the contestant freedom of design interpretation. The contest promoters,
          clients and organisers and their responsibilities must be clearly identified in the brief. </p>

        <p>A contest is a means to assess at an early stage of a project's development, a preliminary approach to
          design. The level of information sought should always be considered provisional and proportionate. The amount
          of information sought in any contest has a direct relationship to the cost of running and holding that
          contest, the level of honorariums and the assessment timescale. (Menteth et al., 2015)</p>

        <p>✅ Assess from the project briefing stage the key issues and questions to be raised and addressed in a design
          contest. </p>

        <h3><a name="SingleofMultistagedesigncontest"></a>Single of Multi-stage design contest</h3>

        <p>If possible, a design contest should be held in a single stage, As long as the design brief does not incur
          unreasonable expenditure for the submitters to present enough detail for the jury selection.</p>

        <p>A two-stage submission is the recommended approach when a project brief is large, complex or calls for a
          particularly immersive technical understanding, or when projects may attract large numbers of participants.
        </p>

        <p>✅ Where two stages are used, the first stage should be made as light as possible to avoid unnecessary
          submission, assessment and procedural costs to all parties. (Menteth et al., 2015)</p>

        <h3><a name="ReturnofDesigns"></a>Return of Designs</h3>

        <p>Where possible all submissions should be made digitally, using open formats and platforms. Avoid requiring
          multiple formats or needed to submit the same information in multiple files or formats. Any submission
          platform should allow the participant to review, amend and attach information for submission before the
          submission date. This assists participants in getting used to the submission platform and supports getting the
          submission in correctly on time.</p>

        <p><img class="emoticon" src="./KBA export (JIRA)_files/warning.png" height="16" width="16" align="absmiddle"
            alt="" border="0"> The level of information requested needs to be consistent with the budget allowed for the
          scope of the project, and budget available by plan of work stage.</p>

        <p>✅ Allow teams some latitude in terms of what they choose to present and try not to be overly prescriptive.
          This can be an important means of assessing their ability to communicate design ideas to members of the
          judging panel and the general public. _(<em>Menteth et al., 2015</em>)_</p>

        <h3><a name="EvaluationofDesigns"></a>Evaluation of Designs</h3>

        <p>Getting the assessment criteria right, is really important. The criteria should be clear with a description
          of what is expected against the various areas of requirements within the brief.</p>

        <p>The judging panel assess each submission against the selection criteria, the response to the Q&amp;As and,
          note any input from technical reviewers. Assessments must be minuted both for record keeping, but also to
          provide feedback to unsuccessful applications.</p>

        <p>The final decisions must be reported and include the rankings of the final selection and also and other
          contestants rankings. (Menteth et al., 2015)</p>

        <p>✅ Encourage good, balanced intelligent judgement. </p>

        <p>✅ Identify the key criteria and ensure they can be measured. </p>

        <p>✅ Don’t deviate from the published selection criteria. (If the conditions say submissions should comprise
          only of ideas and sketches, it is not then acceptable to go for fully completed designs). </p>

        <p>✅ Where appropriate, give each criterion a weighting. Weightings should always be consistent with project
          aspirations and promote design excellence but should give reasoned consideration to balance and holistic
          outcomes. </p>

        <h3><a name="StandstillPeriod"></a>Standstill Period</h3>

        <p>A standstill period is required_._ This is a mandatory 10-day period between competitors being notified of
          the result and the contract being able to be awarded to the winning designer.</p>

        <p>The purpose of the Standstill Period is to give unsuccessful bidders some time to: (<em>Standstill Period |
            Supplier Journey</em>,)</p>

        <ul>
          <li>consider the feedback (Debrief) provided on their bid by the procurement officer</li>
          <li>seek further information</li>
          <li>call for a review of the procurement officer decision</li>
          <li>challenge the decision</li>
        </ul>


        <h3><a name="Negotiation%2Caward%2Corprize"></a>Negotiation, award, or prize</h3>

        <p>If a local authority wants the right design idea before there is certainty that a project will go ahead,
          whether to show what is possible for promotional purposes or to attract investment, the local authority can
          consider running a Design Contest which should include a prize or payment to the winning or placed schemes_._
        </p>

        <p>It is possible to include an optional intent in the contest notice to follow the Design Contest followed by a
          <b>Negotiated Procedure without prior publication</b> of a contract notice. This enables a local authority to
          enter into a negotiation with the winner to establish a working agreement with a practice of their choice to
          provide any additional capacity and resource needed to deliver the project. (<em>Ten Principles for Procuring
            Better Outcomes</em>, 2016)</p>

        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Declare a climate emergency.</b></li>
          <li><b>Prepare a climate action plan.</b></li>
          <li><b>Create a strategic plan to identify the impacts of climate change and the pathway to Net Zero for their

        </ul>


        <p>There will be variation in approaches in different local authorities due to political, historical,
          geographical and social aspects. A Local Authority may be using a climate emergency to reinforce work already
          underway, whereas another may be using it as a springboard to begin their low carbon journey. Some authorities
          may want to build an internal capability to deliver projects while others will want become an intelligent
          client and use the commercial sector to deliver the expertise required.</p>

        <p>The timeline below provides an overview of the key common stages across the different local authorities (LA)
          from the declaration of climate emergency to developing a climate action plan. Stages tend to be similar
          between LAs, although the order of them may vary – and many are iterative, rather than strictly linear
          journeys. Some LAs will have been developing a climate plan prior to declaring a climate emergency, but the
          stages tend to be similar.</p>

        <p>By declaring a Climate Emergency you’ve acknowledged that your Council needs to act on the causes and impacts
          of climate change. This is a major leap forward; political commitment is often the hardest part.</p>

        <h1><a name="Createaclimateactionplan"></a>Create a climate action plan</h1>

        <p>A climate action plan allows all local stakeholders to agree to the scope and speed of change required to get
          on a Net zero pathway. It is as much a political tool as it is a practical roadmap.</p>

        <h2><a name="Createanenergymasterplan"></a>Create an energy masterplan</h2>

        <p>The objective of the energy masterplan is to provide a clear picture and sound evidence base outlining the
          potential for the delivery of decentralised energy networks with the relevant stakeholders. The energy
          masterplan should include spatial maps that allow area planners and project developers to identify energy
          opportunities at the earliest possible stage and can assist the commissioning of projects in consideration of
          the wider energy context. Energy Masterplans can help raise wider organisation awareness and political
          support, as well as providing a low carbon evidence base.</p>

        <p>Look at local development plans (already in the planning system) to see how many new houses there will be to
          2030 or the date in the climate emergency plan.</p>

        <p>Include the extra consumption from those including supporting infrastructure (eg street lights outside those
          new homes, electric vehicle charging) and look at what installed capacity would be needed to meet the
          additional demand.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2><a name="CreateaLocalAreaEnergyPlan"></a>Create a Local Area Energy Plan</h2>

        <p>Local area energy planning (LAEP) is a process which has the potential to inform, shape and enable key
          aspects of the transition to a net zero carbon energy system.</p>

        <p>Meeting the challenge of energy system decarbonisation needs local leadership, engagement and
          initiative-taking. This is because of both (a) the nature and challenges of the systemic changes required (and
          how they vary between places) and (b) the sheer volume and distribution of people and organisations who will
          need to be involved in making them.</p>

        <p>If done well, LAEP can provide sound foundations for effective and sustained local action to cut carbon
          emissions taken by well-informed local leaders and initiative-takers. The resulting plan can potentially
          underpin specific proposals to upgrade local energy networks to enable decarbonisation in line with local
          objectives. Done well and consistently across many localities, LAEP can inform sharper, more effective and
          better targeted national policies.</p>

        <h1><a name="CommonExperiencesacrossmanyLocalAuthorities"></a>Common Experiences across many Local Authorities
        </h1>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><b>Declaring a climate emergency is a political decision for local authorities and it is driven by the
            elected members and public interest.</b> After the political commitment, relevant LA officers are appointed
          to be responsible for coordinating climate action in their LAs.</p>

        <p><b>There are not any distinct national policies identified as catalysts for accelerating local authorities
            climate action.</b> The UK’s Net-Zero by 2050 pledge is influencing at a high-level some of the LAs that
          have decided to address the carbon emissions of their wider area.</p>

        <p><b>Building a successful climate action plan involves engaging with several departments within the LA such as
            housing, transport, ecology etc.</b> Each team brings their own expertise into the planning process and will
          hold some level of power and influence over climate action in the LA.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><b>It is important to define where in their local area the LAs have control and influence in order to build a
            realistic action plan</b>. LAs will not have the power to directly control all carbon emissions in their
          wider area, but they can promote change through indirect action, influence and encouragement.</p>

        <p><b>Change in political leadership after elections may affect climate action in the LAs due to conflicting
            aspirations between the parties.</b> Officers have found that establishing cross-party councillor working
          groups early on can mitigate this risk and ensure unanimous decision-making within the process.</p>

        <p><b>Carbon emissions data scarcity or storage in a format that cannot be processed is a common issue that
            local authorities are facing.</b> As a result, carbon footprint baselining can be challenging. LAs have
          found that carbon emissions datasets from BEIS can be used instead of their missing data.</p>

        <p><b>Local authorities generally prefer creating their climate action plans using in-house expertise as they
            have a better understanding of where the majority of emissions are coming from and know the challenges and
            opportunities in their local area better.</b> Well resourced LAs with dedicated energy and sustainability
          teams (usually larger LAs) are able to create their climate action plans with minimal external input; however,
          human resource-constrained LAs are required to get external support i.e. consultancy to finalise their plans.
        </p>

        <p><b>In building their climate action plans, local authorities place a high importance on:</b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Regular engagement with the councillors through working groups,</li>
          <li>Regular engagement with the other relevant departments within the LA through working groups,</li>
          <li>Engagement with the local community (local organisations and citizens) through public consultation events
            in-person and online.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>Wider engagement is important to encourage input and ensure approval along the process of creating the
          climate action plan.</p>

        <p><b>Local authorities work collaboratively and share learnings and expertise with each other on technological
            know-how, best practices and things to avoid when creating a climate action plan</b>. Usually the larger,
          more advanced LAs are the ones who share their capabilities and lead by example, having a positive effect on
          smaller, less advanced LAs. Sharing is done on both an informal (one-to-one) basis and formally (for example,
          through networks).</p>

        <h1><a name="DifferencesinApproachesbetweenLocalAuthorities"></a>Differences in Approaches between Local
          Authorities</h1>

        <p><b>For some LAs, the declaration of climate emergency has been essential for taking action and creating
            climate strategies to reduce their carbon footprint.</b> For others, it was a political decision with
          minimal influence on their plans to tackle the impact of climate change in their area and formalised work they
          were already doing.</p>

        <p><b>Some local authorities focus their decarbonisation strategies on reducing their corporate carbon
            emissions, whereas others decide to develop action plans both for their own LA targets and the countywide
            targets.</b> The latter are usually larger LAs that have larger teams of in-house staff and expertise
          required to support emissions reduction in their wider area.</p>

        <p><b>Given their budget constrains, many local authorities rely on Government funding to prepare and execute
            their climate action plans.</b> Other local authorities are self-funding their decarbonisation activities
          from their own revenues, using EU funding or exploring more innovative financing solutions or investment
          opportunities. Avenues explored include Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), Heat-as-a-Service business models;
          even crowd funding had been considered.</p>

        <p><b>Only a small number of LAs are well-resourced and have dedicated energy and sustainability teams of
            subject matter experts.</b> The resource-constrained LAs often lack the human capital to support climate
          action in their wider area and rely on external expertise, resource and guidance.</p>

        <p><b>Some LAs have sought tailored Consultancy support to develop their plans, whereas others have been able to
            largely develop them in-house.</b></p>

        <p><b>Public consultation was recognised as an important component of developing a plan but approaches and
            levels of success varied.</b> Many LAs reported successful public consultation exercises with feedback
          gathered and fed into the process. A smaller number of LAs struggled to properly plan and execute sufficient
          consultations to get the required input, and there were concerns it could be seen as tokenism. In some cases,
          consultation exercises seemed to be focused on gathering input to shape policies – in other instances, they
          seemed more focused on getting public approval.</p>

        <p><b>Partnership working with external organisations was common but, again, with varying levels of success</b>.
          Some LAs commented that partners’ input and/or close partnership working was essential in forming their plans.
          Others reported issues with this joint working; for example, challenges of working with DNOs where a lack of
          understanding between the two organisations hindered successful joint working.</p>

        <p><b>Timescales to develop climate action plans vary.</b> For most LAs, the period between declaration of
          climate emergencies and development of an action plan was between several months and two years. However, some
          organisations have been developing climate plans for years and recent work could build upon this. The detail
          and scope of climate plans was not assessed as part of this project, and it is possible that this may vary
          based on the length of time taken to develop plans.</p>

        <p>This is based on the Treasury green book project guidance using the 5 case model. The Strategic outline case

        <p>The purpose of the Strategic Outline Case (SOC) is to provide the necessary information in a format that will
          enable the authority and any public sector partners to assess the scope of the project and any investments in
          impacts and benefits.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="customfield_12982">

        <p>In a multi-authority scheme a combined SOC should be considered, but in doing so the outline case must
          recognise the project’s overall impact as well as the impact and implications for the individual authorities.
          In particular, the SOC will need to ensure that it explains how the project links to the impact strategy.</p>

        <p>A number of areas should be specifically addressed in the preparation of a SOC. These are:</p>

        <p>SOC aims</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Strategic context</li>

        <h1><a name="SOCaims"></a>SOC aims</h1>

        <h2><a name="Strategiccontext"></a>Strategic context</h2>

        <p>The local authority/authorities should set out their strategy for service provision and demonstrate how the
          proposed scheme matches this. It is important that the SOC considers not only the services to be dealt with in
          the project but also the wider impact of the project on the authority and other stakeholders, for example
          employees.</p>

        <p>Proposals should have been discussed in outline with wider stakeholders.</p>

        <h2><a name="Serviceneed"></a>Service need</h2>

        <p>The service need for the proposed scheme should be demonstrated by detailing the service issues that the
          scheme is intended to address.</p>

        <h2><a name="Formulationofoptions"></a>Formulation of options</h2>

        <p>A shortlist of options that satisfy service need, match strategy and are affordable should be developed. If
          the analysis establishes a clear preference for a particular option, this should be identified.</p>

        <h2><a name="Affordability"></a>Affordability</h2>

        <p>The affordability ceiling for a scheme should be defined and accepted by the local authority/authorities.
          Local authorities should take account of any changes in the local economy resulting from the scheme.</p>

        <h2><a name="Timetableanddeliverability"></a>Timetable and deliverability</h2>

        <p>The proposed project timetable for awarding a contract <span class="error">[\[HW1]</span>|]&nbsp;should be
          set out. Important milestones that must be reached before a scheme can be formally advertised in the <a

        <p>The Outline Business Case (OBC) aims to evaluate and identify the preferred option for delivery of the

          out the possible deal while confirming affordability and putting in place the management arrangements for the
          successful delivery of the project.</p>

        <p>At conclusion of the OBC, senior management should be in a position to consent to the procurement phase of

        </ul>


        <h2><a name="Theeconomiccase"></a>The economic case</h2>

        <p>The next step in the development of the economic case appraises the social, environmental and economic costs,
          benefits and risks for the shortlisted options and identifies the preferred option: the option most likely to
          offer the best social value for delivery of the project. While bringing together a variety of information on
          costs, benefits and risks to aid decision making, option appraisal should not be seen as unequivocally
          providing the ‘right’ answer.</p>

        <p>The goal is ‘optimal’: we are seeking to identify the option which best balances the expected costs in
          relation to the benefits and risks.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Revisit and refine the efficacy of the preferred way forward and other options in the shortlist, because
            more detailed information of the associated inputs, outputs and activities will be required for preparing
            the economic appraisals.</li>
          <li>Calculate the discounted costs and benefits for the shortlisted options and record the discounted values
            and benefit/cost ratios (BCRs) for each option.</li>
          <li>Undertake an appraisal of the quantifiable and qualitative benefits and explain why these are important
            enough to affect the decision for the ranking of the options. The main aim is to identify benefits that are
            quantifiable and can be expressed in monetary equivalent terms and to avoid defining benefits that cannot be
            measured, assessed or evaluated in any realistic way because there is no established evidence base.</li>
          <li>Identify and quantify the risks associated with the options contained in the economic appraisals for the
            project’s shortlisted options.</li>
          <li>Selecting the preferred option should be reasonably straightforward in the decision-making process if the
            required analysis has been rigorously undertaken.</li>

        <p>The purpose of the management case is to put in place the arrangements for the successful delivery of the
          project.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Put in place the strategy, framework and plans for successful project delivery using a proven methodology
            for guiding investments through a controlled, well-managed and visible set of activities to achieve the
            desired results and benefits.</li>

            benefits.</li>
          <li>Put in place arrangements for managing and mitigating risks during the key phases of the project.</li>

        <h2><a name="Thecommercialcase"></a>The commercial case</h2>

        <p>The purpose of the commercial case is to set out the procurement arrangements for the project’s key outputs
          and activities. These arrangements need to be considered from the outset in order to secure long-term public
          value during the operational phase of the project.</p>

        <p>Completing the commercial case requires undertaking the following actions for the preferred option identified
          in the economic case.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Determine the procurement strategy and possible procurement routes for the project’s key outputs and
            activities.</li>
          <li>Identify the project’s service streams and required outputs and the scope and content of the potential
            deal to be made with public and private sector service providers.</li>
          <li>Identify how the service risks in the design, build, funding and operational (DBFO) phases of the project
            may be apportioned between the public and private sectors.</li>
          <li>Identify how the project intends to pay for its key services and outputs over the expected lifespan of the
            contract(s).</li>
          <li>Outline the contractual arrangements for the project, including the use of a particular contract, the key
            contractual issues and its accountancy treatment and personnel implications.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2><a name="Thefinancialcase"></a>The financial case</h2>

        <p>The purpose of the financial case is to ascertain the affordability and funding requirements of the preferred
          option and to demonstrate that the recommended project is affordable. This involves determining the funding
          and affordability of the proposed project on the organisation’s income and expenditure account, balance sheet
          and prices for its services.</p>

        <p>The focuses of the financial and economic appraisals are different. The economic appraisal focuses on the
          value for money of the overall project. The financial appraisal focuses on the affordability and fundability
          of the project. The costs and benefits appraised in the financial case reflect an accountancy-based
          perspective. Consequently, both resource and non-resource costs and benefits are factored into the analysis;
          so, for example, whereas VAT and depreciation are excluded from the economic appraisal, these costs are
          included in the financial appraisal because they have a direct bearing on the affordability of the project.

        <blockquote>
          <p>What needs to be done when, what level of detail and what decisions need to be made.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The <b>plan of work</b> is a whole lifecycle project definition and delivery structure that allows clear
          communication of progress, actions and expected outputs. It allows decision makers and the project teams to
          use a common and consistent approach to structuring a project and making sure that the right information is
          available at the right time. It also allows other stakeholders, such as investors, to understand at which
          points in a project development cycle they can most efficiently engage.</p>

        <h2><a name="ProjectManagement"></a><b>Project Management</b></h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Who is doing what, to what quality and how it is paid for.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The <b>project manager</b>, who is part of the project team, would use a recognised methodology such as
          PRINCE2 and PMBOK depending on the organisations standard approach to manage the organisation, resources and
          budgets to delivery the project to time, cost and quality. Different Stages of the project may be managed
          using different approaches, by different project managers depending on the procurement and delivery approach
          chosen.</p>

        <h2><a name="Businesscase"></a><b>Business case</b></h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Clear description of the impacts, risks and rewards that the project will accrue, for presentation to
            decision makers.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The <b>business case</b> is the document that decision makers use to assure that the project will deliver
          what it promises in terms of interventions, assets, revenues and impact. The business case is vital to gaining
          funding and finance. As such, it is a component part of delivering a robust project. A business case doesn't
          include any technical details about the solution specification, users or operational details.</p>

        <p>The 5 case model is a business case development framework recommended by HM Treasury through the green book.

        <p>This is based on the Treasury green book project guidance using the 5 case model. The Full Business Case
          (FBC) concentrates primarily on revisiting and updating the conclusions of the Outline Business Case (OBC) and
          documenting the outcomes of the procurement.</p>

        <p>The purpose of the Full Business Case (FBC) is to identify the marketplace opportunity that offers optimum
          Value for Money (VfM), set out the commercial and contractual arrangements for the negotiated deal, confirm
          the deal is still affordable and put in place the detailed management arrangements for the successful
          delivery, monitoring and evaluation of the scheme.</p>

        <p>Much of the work involved in producing the FBC focuses on revisiting and updating the conclusions of the
          Outline Business Case (OBC) and documenting the outcomes of the procurement.</p>

        <p>On completion of the FBC, a Gateway Review 3 (investment decision) should be considered for the project,
          prior to the formal submission of the FBC to the approving authority. All parties should now be content for
          the project to proceed to contract signature, providing the above work has been completed satisfactorily and
          the resultant scheme is affordable.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Five Cases in the FBC</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The Strategic case</li>
          <li>The Economic case</li>
          <li>The Project Management case</li>

        <h2><a name="TheStrategiccase"></a>The Strategic case</h2>

        <p>Confirm that the case for change remains as set out in the OBC. Additional business needs and requirements
          that have arisen since the submission and approval of the OBC will require the case for change to be revisited
          and updated.</p>

        <p>Ensure the spending objectives have been made SMART for the purpose of post evaluation and updated to reflect
          the latest information regarding the rationale, drivers, anticipated outcomes and benefits for the project.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Revisit the case for change, because the rationale for the project may have altered since the OBC was
            approved, due to evolving business needs and changing service requirements.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2><a name="TheEconomiccase"></a>The Economic case</h2>

        <p>To confirm that the options identified in the OBC economic case are still valid and their rankings remain the
          same. The purpose of this action is to evidence that the preferred option remains the same as that identified
          at the OBC stage. Any new options must be clearly identified and any adjustments to existing options
          explained.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Confirm that the conclusions of the OBC economic appraisal still remain valid at FBC stage.</li>
          <li>Update the economic case to provide a summary of the procurement process and how the Best and Final Offers
            (BAFOs) were evaluated and the preferred bidder selected.</li>
          <li>Confirm the procurement strategy, route and evaluation criteria were followed as set out in the OBC and
            explain any changes.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2><a name="TheProjectManagementcase"></a>The Project Management case</h2>

        <p>This step requires revisiting and updating the management dimension of the business case to record the
          detailed management arrangements that have been put in place to ensure the successful delivery and evaluation
          of the project.</p>

        <p>In all cases, explain what has been agreed and finalised for the successful delivery of the project in
          accordance with best practice.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Revisit the project management arrangements and plans that were outlined in the OBC.</li>
          <li>Revisit the change management arrangements and plans that were outlined in the OBC.</li>
          <li>Revisit the benefits realisation arrangements and plans that were outlined in the OBC.</li>
          <li>Revisit the risk management arrangements and plans that were outlined in the OBC.</li>
          <li>Record the contract management arrangements and plans that have been agreed and finalised for the
            successful management of the service in accordance with best practice. This should include both the formal
            and informal arrangements that have been put in place for the strategic and operational management of the
            contract.</li>
          <li>Revisit the post project evaluation arrangements and plans that were outlined in the OBC.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2><a name="TheCommercialcase"></a>The Commercial case</h2>

        <p>This step involves revisiting and updating the commercial case dimension of the business case to reflect the
          negotiated deal and its financial consequences over the lifespan of the contract and service.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Document the deal that has been negotiated by the public sector organisation and its choice of service
            provider.</li>

            <p>Is the project needed and does it work with other initiatives and programmes. Will it further the aims of
              the local authority.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The purpose of the strategic dimension of the business case is to make the case for change and to demonstrate
          how it provides strategic fit.</p>

        <p>Demonstrating that the scheme provides synergy and holistic fit with other projects and programmes within the
          strategic portfolio requires an up-to-date organisational business strategy that references all relevant
          local, regional and national policies and targets.</p>

        <p>Making a robust case for change requires a clear understanding of the rationale, drivers and objectives for
          the spending proposal, which must be made SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time
          constrained – for the purposes of post-evaluation.</p>

        <p>Key to making a compelling case for intervention is a clear understanding of the existing arrangements: the
          Business As Usual (BAU), business needs (related problems and opportunities), potential scope (the required
          organisational capabilities) and the potential benefits, risks, constraints and dependencies associated with
          the proposal.</p>

        <p>The challenges are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>to explain how further intervention and spend on key ‘inputs’ will deliver ‘outputs’ that improve the
            organisation’s capability to deliver better outcomes and benefits to stakeholders and customers, while
            recognising the associated risks</li>
          <li>to ensure the organisation’s proposals focus on business needs that have been well researched and are
            supported by service demand and capacity planning</li>
          <li>to ensure schemes are planned and delivered as part of an approved organisational strategy that has a well
            defined portfolio of related programmes and projects.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2><a name="TheEconomicCase"></a>The Economic Case</h2>

        <div class="panel" style="background-color: #e3fcef;border-width: 1px;">
          <div class="panelContent" style="background-color: #e3fcef;">
            <p>Is the project value for money? Have a number of options been considered? What is the best balance of
              cost, impact and risk?</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The purpose of the economic dimension of the business case is to identify the proposal that delivers best
          public value to society, including wider social and environmental effects. Demonstrating public value requires
          a wide range of realistic options to be appraised (the long-list), in terms of how well they meet the spending
          objectives and critical success factors for the scheme; and then a reduced number of possible options (the
          short-list) to be examined in further detail. The short-list must include the Business As Usual (BAU), a
          realistic and achievable ‘do minimum’ that meets essential requirements, the preferred way forward (if this is
          different) and any other options that have been carried forward. These options are subjected to cost benefit
          analysis (CBA) or cost effectiveness analysis (CEA), where more appropriate, to identify the option that
          offers best public value to society. The challenges are: ¨ to begin by selecting the ‘right’ options for
          scope, solution, service delivery, implementation and funding, otherwise options will represent sub-optimal
          Value for Money (VfM) from the outset ¨ to justify higher cost options in relation to BAU and the ‘do minimum’
          ¨ to measure and monetise the benefits and risks.</p>

        <h2><a name="TheCommercialCase"></a>The Commercial Case</h2>

        <div class="panel" style="background-color: #e3fcef;border-width: 1px;">
          <div class="panelContent" style="background-color: #e3fcef;">
            <p>Is it viable? Can it be procured?</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The purpose of the commercial dimension of the business case is to demonstrate that the preferred option will
          result in a viable procurement and a well-structured Deal between the public sector and its service providers.
          Demonstrating a viable procurement requires an understanding of the market place, knowledge of what is
          realistically achievable by the supply side and research into the procurement routes that will deliver best
          value to both parties. Putting in place a well-structured Deal requires a clear understanding of the services,
          outputs and milestones required to be achieved and of how the potential risks in the Design, Build, Funding
          and Operational (DBFO) phases of the scheme can best be allocated between the public and private sectors and
          reflected in the charging mechanism and contractual arrangements. The challenge for the public sector is to be
          an ‘intelligent customer’ and to anticipate from the outset how best public value can continue to be secured
          in during the contract phase in the face of inevitable changes to business, organisational and operational
          requirements.</p>

        <h2><a name="TheFinancialCase"></a>The Financial Case</h2>

        <div class="panel" style="background-color: #e3fcef;border-width: 1px;">
          <div class="panelContent" style="background-color: #e3fcef;">
            <p>Is it affordable? Can others invest in it? How does it get paid for?</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The purpose of the financial dimension of the business case is to demonstrate the affordability and funding
          of the preferred option, including the support of stakeholders and customers, as required. Demonstrating the
          affordability and fundability of the preferred option requires a complete understanding of the capital,
          revenue and whole life costs of the scheme and of how the Deal will impact upon the balance sheet, income and
          expenditure and pricing arrangements (if any) of the organisation. The challenge is to identify and resolve
          any potential funding gaps during the lifespan of the scheme.</p>

        <h2><a name="TheManagementCase"></a>The Management Case</h2>

        <div class="panel" style="background-color: #e3fcef;border-width: 1px;">
          <div class="panelContent" style="background-color: #e3fcef;">
            <p>Is it deliverable? Does the local authority have the capability and capacity to control risks? It is
              described in a consistent way for decision makers?</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The purpose of the management dimension of the business case is to demonstrate that robust arrangements are
          in place for the delivery, monitoring and evaluation of the scheme, including feedback into the organisation’s
          strategic planning cycle. Demonstrating that the preferred option can be successfully delivered requires
          evidencing that the scheme is being managed in accordance with best practice, subjected to independent
          assurance and that the necessary arrangements are in place for change and contract management, benefits
          realisation and risk management.</p>


        <p>The challenges are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>manage the risks in the design, build, funding and operational phases of the scheme<br>
            and put in place contingency plans</li>
          <li>deal with inevitable business and service change in a controlled environment</li>
          <li>ensure that objectives are met, anticipated outcomes delivered and benefits evaluated.</li>

        <p>A well-prepared project business case performs a number of functions. It enables the organisation and its key
          stakeholders to understand, influence and shape the project’s scope and direction early on in the planning
          process. It assists decision-makers to understand the key issues and the available evidence base and to avoid
          committing resources to schemes that should not proceed. It demonstrates to senior management, stakeholders,
          customers and decision-makers the continuing viability of the project, and provides the basis for management,
          monitoring and evaluation during and after implementation</p>
      </td>
      <td class="customfield_12982">
        <p>The project business case must consider the organisational strategy, the project mandate and the project
          brief. The organisational strategy provides the context for the project and is important because experience
          shows that a proposal begins most effectively when it is launched as part of a clear organisational strategy.
          The project mandate provides the trigger and context at the start of the project. The project brief develops
          the concept for the scheme and provides an initial assessment of the viability and achievability of the
          proposal, prior to formally developing the project business case.</p>

        <p>A typical process for developing the project business case aligned with HMT guidance is as follows:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Ensure the mandate and brief for the project have been completed.<br>
            Undertake the strategic assessment.<br>
            Complete the risk profile assessment.<br>
            Draft the scoping document for the project business case and arrange a meeting with<br>
            the business case reviewer/approver to agree the content, governance, reporting,<br>
            assurance and approval arrangements.</li>
          <li>Commence the Strategic Outline Case (SOC).
            <ol>
              <li>Prepare the strategic case following completion of Workshop 1 (Determining the<br>
                case for change).<br>
                Prepare the economic case following Workshop 2 (Appraising the longlist).<br>
                Provide an overview of the commercial, financial and management case sections.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Undertake <b>Cabinet Office Gateway 0</b>&nbsp; <b>(business justification).</b><br>
            Submit the Strategic Outline Case (SOC) for approval.</li>
          <li>Commence the Outline Business Case (OBC).
            <ol>
              <li>Revisit the case for change.<br>
                Revisit the economic dimension of the case following Workshop 3 (Appraising the<br>
                shortlist).<br>
                Prepare the commercial dimension of the case following Workshop 4 (Developing<br>
                the deals).<br>
                Prepare the financial dimension of the case with the finance directorate.<br>
                Prepare the management dimension of the case following Workshop 5 (Successful<br>
                delivery arrangements).</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Undertake a <b>Cabinet Office Gateway Review 2 (delivery strategy)</b>.<br>
            Submit the Outline Business Case (OBC) for approval.</li>
          <li>Following procurement, prepare the Full Business Case (FBC).
            <ol>
              <li>Revisit OBC assumptions for the 5 cases.<br>
                Update the economic appraisals to reflect best and final offers (BAFOs).<br>
                Select the most economically advantageous tender (MEAT).</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Undertake a <b>Cabinet Office Gateway Review 3 (investment decision)</b>.<br>
            Submit the Full Business Case (FBC) for approval.<br>
            Monitor project delivery and undertake a <b>Cabinet Office Gateway Review 4 (readiness</b><br>
            <b>for service)</b> prior to going live.<br>
            Use the Full Business Case (FBC) to support post-evaluation and benefit realisation.<br>
            Undertake a <b>Cabinet Office Gateway Review 5 (operations review and benefits</b><br>
            <b>realisation)</b>. Items 14 and 15 may be combined where it makes sense to do so.<br>
            Feed back findings into the strategic planning cycle.
          </li>
        </ol>


        <p>The above process and level of effort will vary depending on the nature of the organisation, the<br>
          decision being sought and the expectations agreed in the scoping document</p>

        <p>In theory and practice, the term&nbsp;<em>business model</em>&nbsp;is used to describe many different core

        <h3><a name="WhyusetheBusinessModelCanvas%3F"></a>Why use the Business Model Canvas?</h3>

        <h3><a name="Createasharedlanguage"></a>Create a shared language</h3>

        <p>This concept can become a shared language that allows you to easily describe and adapt business models to
          create new strategic alternatives. Without such a shared language it is difficult to systematically challenge
          assumptions about one’s business and innovate successfully.</p>

        <h3><a name="Simple%2Cvisualandpractical"></a>Simple, visual and practical</h3>

        <p>The canvas is perfect for any good discussion, meeting or workshop on business model innovation. We need a
          concept that everybody understands: one that facilitates description and discussion. We need to start from the
          same point and talk about the same thing. The challenge is that the concept must be simple, relevant and
          intuitively understandable, while not oversimplifying the complexities of how enterprises function.&nbsp;</p>

        <h3><a name="Discoveropportunities"></a>Discover opportunities</h3>

        <p>By going through the process of listing the different parts of your business on the canvas, you begin to
          visualise and understand the different relationships between the 9 building blocks that make up the tool.</p>

        <h3><a name="Iteratequickly"></a>Iterate quickly</h3>

        <p>Whether you’re using sticky notes on a real life Business Model Canvas or you’re designing your business
          model on the&nbsp;Strategyzer app, you can update your designs very quickly. The tool enables you to develop a
          prototype and simply keep iterating until you’ve tested enough ideas to find product-market fit</p>

        <p>It is necessary to understand the business case for a project because feasibility studies [Feasibility
          Studies ] may identify several possible approaches in response to the local authority’s needs. Conversely,
          undertaking a financial appraisal to obtain site values may conclude that a new building is a justifiable
          business approach, although this may conflict with the sustainability strategy.</p>

        <p>The business case should tease out the pros and cons of different approaches, considering the project risks
          and project budget of each. The criteria for selecting the most appropriate way forward must be considered and
          different topics might be weighted differently depending on the requirements. For example, on one project,
          adhering to the project budget might be the overriding criterion, while, on another, design quality might
          outweigh other considerations.</p>

        <p>HM Treasury encourages the use of the 5 case model to develop the business case. This is not essential
          depending on the scale of the project and standard approaches used by the local authority. Depending on the
          type of financing or funding it is recommended.</p>

        <p>The localisation and spatial coordination stage is when a coordinated and acceptable design really takes
          form. Continuing on from a settled concept design, the project is drawn up more clearly and communicated with
          the community and wider stakeholders. Local aspects and community engagement are developed alongside
          engineering design and a cost exercise.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="customfield_12982">
        <p>ℹ️ This is a <b>DESIGN</b> stage</p>

        <p>👩‍🏫 The design team and community engagement team are key to this stage. The project team are involved
          where coordination requires project decisions. The construction team may also be involved if the selected
          procurement route requires early contractor or specialist subcontractor inputs.</p>

        <p>📤 Concept design is agreed with key local stakeholders.</p>

        <p>⚡ The information at the end of this stage needs to be coordinated sufficiently to avoid all but the most
          minor of changes at Stage 4 and to make sure that the planning application is based on the best possible
          information.</p>

        <p>As a result of this coordination, the details of the design may change throughout Stage 3 but should always
          take into account the project brief and project objectives. <b>Submission for planning consent</b> may vary
          between the stages, but it usually occurs during or at the end of Stage 3. There may also be discussions with
          planning officers at any of the previous stages.</p>

        <p>✅ Community consultation is usually carried out at this stage to ensure that the project solution is
          beneficial to local citizens.</p>

        <p>Cost information is usually finalised at the end of RIBA Stage 3</p>

        <p>ℹ️ This a DESIGN stage<br>
          📤 The solution concept is approved by the project team and aligned to the project brief.<br>
          👩‍🏫 The project team and the design team are the key players in this stage, along with any specialist<br>
          consultants whose contributions are required to achieve a solution concept that is both robust and aligned
          with the project brief. Under some procurement routes, the construction team may also be engaged in this
          stage.<br>
          ⚡ The crucial consideration at this stage is to determine which actions will contribute to the development of
          the concept. The extent and nature of the tasks to be undertaken, and who should undertake them, will vary
          from project to project.<br>
          The concept proposals must also accommodate inputs from the design team and from specialist consultants,
          including the strategic engineering requirements (building services, civil and structural engineering). The
          proposals must also be coordinated with the project themes, and everything captured in a stage report or
          business case.<br>
          The cost plan should demonstrate that the proposals and outline specification are aligned to the project
          budget. A core challenge is to determine what detailed tasks need to be undertaken at this stage.<br>
          Although Stage 2 is more about broad ideas than detailed analysis, calculations may be required to progress
          specific aspects such as income from generation, approximate energy centre sizing or site constraints.<br>
          If the concept is not certain, or does not have sufficient buy-in from stakeholders, carrying out detailed
          design tasks now can result in futile design work.<br>
          There is no right or wrong approach, but there should be a pragmatic review of what tasks are needed to make
          the concept as robust as possible before Stage 3 begins.<br>
          The client may seek pre-application planning advice on the suitability of the initial proposal from a planning
          adviser or the relevant planning department. The route to building regulations compliance needs to be
          clarified and agreed.<br>
          A Stage 2 design programme must be prepared, in line with the project programme and responsibility matrix, to
          guide the design process and to ensure that the information requirements are included in the stage report and
          signed off</p>

        <p>If Stage 0: strategic definition has determined that a specific project is the best means of achieving the
          requirements, the project team begin the briefing process during Stage 1: preparation and briefing. The

          the outcomes recorded in the project brief and business case.</p>

        <p>It is important to recognise that Stage 1: preparation and briefing is not a design stage. This stage is
          about layering detail and requirements into the project brief before the design process commences at Stage 2.

        <p>ℹ️ This is a PLAN stage<br>
          📤 The project brief or outline business case is approved and given authority to proceed.<br>
          👩‍🏫 Stage 1: preparation and briefing involves only the project team. The skills required will vary
          depending on the specific needs of the client and the project. Developing the project brief and the other
          products of this stage are skills that can be provided by specialists who can also help to select the design
          team. Feasibility studies might need external expertise to assess project risks.<br>
          ⚡ Stage 1: preparation and briefing is to define the information requirements for each project stage and check
          the feasibility of various options.<br>
          An inadequate briefing process can result in delay during Stage 2, as the design team will have to undertake
          additional iterations of the design to tease out and resolve briefing issues.</p>


        <p>The project brief contains guidance on the project outcomes. These may influence how the client, design and
          construction teams are assembled to form the project team, as part of the procurement strategy, and may
          dictate the core milestones in the project programme. Some clients give detailed, prescriptive briefing
          guidance, while others leave such considerations to the design team.</p>


        <p>This stage is about developing the information that the design team will need to commence the design process
          at Stage 2. Feasibility studies might be required in order to tease out the full range of briefing
          considerations and to demonstrate that the spatial requirements can be accommodated on the site. In some
          instances, several options might be prepared, but these options should not be evaluated at this stage.
          Feasibility studies are not part of the design process. For example, illustrative masterplan visions might be
          prepared in order to determine and shape the brief, and to tease out decisions that will be required on
          certain topics, but they are not part of the design process itself. As there is a direct correlation between
          cost and a project's scale, the spatial requirements do need to be tested against the project budget.</p>


        <p>The design team, with appropriate knowledge, skills and experience to deliver the project outcomes, needs to
          be selected in time for Stage 2 to commence. On smaller projects, this team may already have been appointed to
          develop the project brief.</p>


        <p>Feasibility studies are carried out as part of the briefing process, for example to verify whether a site can
          accommodate the needs or to test a particular aspect of the brief, allowing the brief to be honed as required
          later steps in the plan of work.<br>
          Information requirements are set at Stage 1, including what information will be required later stages.</p>

          (RIBA 2022) as a base and adapted it to create a common approach to delivering the core tasks necessary for
          developing and deploying local energy projects.</p>

        <h3><a name="Planphase"></a>Plan phase</h3>

        <p>Plan stages make sure the proposed project fits strategic aims, is feasible and that all information is
          available to begin the design stages.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Stage 0: strategic definition</li>
          <li>Stage 1: preparation and briefing</li>
        </ul>


        <h3><a name="DesignPhase"></a>Design Phase</h3>

        <p>Design stages develop, test, procure and agree the solution to be delivered in the build phase.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Stage 2: concept design</li>
          <li>Stage 3: spatial coordination and localisation</li>
          <li>Stage 4: technical design</li>
        </ul>


        <h3><a name="BuildPhase"></a>Build Phase</h3>

        <p>Build stages cover the construction and handover of the solution to the operation team</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Stage 5: construction, integration and installation</li>
          <li>Stage 6: handover</li>
        </ul>


        <h3><a name="OperatePhase"></a>Operate Phase</h3>

        <p>The operate phase is concerned with the usage, operation and ultimately decommissioning or transition of the
          solution.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Stage 7: use (and operation)</li>

      <td class="customfield_12982">
        <h2><a name="Planphase"></a>Plan phase</h2>

        <p><b>Stage 0: strategic definition</b> is the first of the 2 stages which appraise and define the project
          before a detailed design brief or strategic outline case is created.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The best means of achieving the project requirements is confirmed.</li>
        </ul>


        <p><b>Stage 1: preparation and briefing</b> deals with developing the initial project brief. This includes
          related feasibility studies to enable the development of the concept design. Preparation tasks such as
          assembling the project team and defining each party’s roles and responsibilities take place in this stage.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Project business case approved and given authority to proceed.<br>
            The design team for the concept design may be procured at this stage.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2><a name="Designphase"></a>Design phase</h2>

        <p><b>Stage 2: concept design</b> produces the initial concept<br>
          design in line with the design brief/business case established in Stage 1. This is presented to the
          project/client team for the first time.</p>

        <p>The initial solution components are explored. Potential dependencies and impacts on other projects and
          systems are identified&nbsp;. New ideas and alignments with other projects and programmes are reviewed at this
          stage to ensure opportunities are not missed.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Concept design developed and agreed.<br>
            Business case updated.</li>
        </ul>


        <p><b>Stage 3: spatial coordination and localisation</b> develops the concept design to align and enhance local
          aspects of the solution.</p>

        <p>Targeted buildings, land and vehicles (assets) are identified and consultations with users, local people and
          other stakeholders as to the acceptability of the proposed solution are carried out.</p>

        <p>Local constraints such as grid capacity, connection requirements and potential disruption are identified. The
          planning or connection documents (if required) are submitted for approval.</p>

        <p>This is the final opportunity to change the scope of the project. Beyond this stage the scope is fixed,
          although the solution may evolve through engineering or cost analysis.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Once approved, the project moved to Stage 4: technical design<br>
            The team for the technical design may be procured at this stage.</li>
        </ul>


        <p><b>Stage 4: technical design</b> identifies design packages and identifies who will deliver them. The
          principal designer will consult with the local building and planning regulations officer to prepare the
          detailed design package to the specification.</p>

        <p>This is an iterative process and more public consultation or discussions with users and Distribution Network
          Operators (DNOs)&nbsp;may take place.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Full specification developed.<br>
            The team for the construction may be procured at this stage.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2><a name="Buildphase"></a>Build phase</h2>

        <p><b>Stage 5: construction, integration and installation</b> implements the solution. Drawings and information
          produced in the previous stages are used. The principal designer helps ensure a smooth construction process.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Deliver the project solution.</li>
        </ul>


        <p><b>Stage 6: handover</b> facilitates the successful handover of the completed project. Inspection of the
          completed works is carried out and any defects rectified. Any necessary certification is produced.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Handover of project to operational team.</li>
        </ul>


        <h1><a name="Operatephase"></a>Operate phase</h1>

        <p><b>Stage 7: use (and operation)</b> covers the operation set-up, post-occupancy evaluation, project
          performance and outcomes.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Operate and evaluate success of project.</li>
          <li>Decommission or supersede at end of end</li>

        <p>The main goal of categorising risk is to avoid any unpleasant surprises. It also provides a systemic,

        <p><b>Business Risks</b> – These risks remain entirely with the organisation, cannot be transferred by the
          organisation and include political and reputational risks.</p>

        <p><b>Service Risks</b> – These associated risks fall within the design, build, financing and operational phases
          of the project and may be shared with others from outside the organisation.</p>

        <p><b>External Risks</b> – These non-systemic risks affect everyone in society and are not connected directly
          with the proposal. They are inherently unpredictable and random in nature. They include technological
          disruption, legislation, general inflation and catastrophic risks.</p>

        <p>High-level and detailed risk categories can be helpful to identify possible risks.</p>

        <p>High-level categories are the main areas where risks can be found.<span class="error">[\[HW1]</span>|]&nbsp;
          Each of these areas can impact a project in a number of ways during design, delivery or operational stages.
          High-level risk categories are helpful when carrying out risk analysis with stakeholders. Participants are
          often much more knowledgeable in certain areas of risk than others, and this framework can help to ensure that
          all areas are considered and the right people are consulted.</p>

        <p>Benefits are the societal good that projects achieve and the reason those projects are implemented. <span
            class="error">[\[HW1]</span>|]&nbsp;Benefits are measurable improvements resulting from the final result or
          outcome.</p>

        <p>The benefits can be the hardest part of a project to measure. They are of particular interest to the people
          who have to decide to carry out the project. To measure them you can use collected data, statistics or
          surveys.</p>

        <p>Defining your benefits within a standard framework can help identify potential opportunities to create impact
          and change. A benefits framework can also provide a robust approach to testing whether a proposed benefit is
          realistic and if it is measurable.</p>

        <p>We have provided a list of benefits that a local energy project could provide that have developed alongside
          the Ashden Co-Benefits Toolkit (Ashden 2021) and the case studies referenced in this project.</p>

        <p>The list below is not considered complete, but covers the benefits identified through the projects in the

        <p>Benefits included in a project’s aims must have actions and measurements associated with them to ensure that
          the benefit is achievable and delivered by the project.</p>

        <p>The Plan of Work is Net Zero Go’s structured journey for local energy projects, consisting of a framework of
          project stages, activities, checklists, tools, and much more.</p>

        <p>By putting your project through the Plan of Work, from <em>Stage 0: Strategic Definition</em>, all the way
          through to <em>Stage 7: Use &amp; Operations</em>, you can build and mature your project. You will be
          supported on where to start to give your project an identity, have an understanding of what activities to
          complete and when, and be presented with supporting knowledge at the relevant time.</p>

        <p>The goal is that through the Plan of Work, and all of the resources it contains, you are guided through the
          lifecycle of a project toward successful delivery!</p>

        <h1><a name="PlanofWork%3AStructure"></a>Plan of Work: Structure</h1>

        <h1><a name="Stages"></a>Stages</h1>

        <p>The Plan of Work comprises eight stages, which are designed to act together to inform the briefing, design,
          construction, handover and use of a project. The Plan of Work can be used by a project team at the outset of a
          project, to help set up their project, or during the project, as a constant point of reference –to remind them
          of the core tasks that should be undertaken at any particular stage.</p>

        <p>In addition to understanding the outcomes of each stage, it is crucial to recognise how the Plan of Work
          facilitates the progression of several priorities, defined here as Project Strategies, through the stages.</p>

        <p>The majority of the stages work on a standalone basis. However, achieving successful outcomes at one stage
          relies on achieving successful outcomes at the stage before.</p>

        <div class="panel" style="background-color: #ffebe6;border-width: 1px;">
          <div class="panelContent" style="background-color: #ffebe6;">
            <p>Where the outcomes from one stage are poor, it would be difficult to recover in the next stage. For
              example:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>A poor Project Brief is likely to lead to poor design outcomes</li>
              <li>A poor design will not achieve exemplary Project Outcomes</li>
              <li>Designs that are not Spatially and locally Coordinated in Stage 3 will result in unnecessary
                iterations in Stage 4</li>
              <li>Poor information in Stage 4 will create an unnecessary volume of Site Queries during construction</li>
              <li>Lack of foresight on operation and maintenance in the early stages may create challenges and
                unnecessary costs during the in use stage.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>In many instances, there will be cross-cutting issues that flow from one stage to another, or information
          produced by one party that is crucial to another at the next stage.</p>

        <p>In this regard, while each stage acts independently, the Plan of Work works as a whole. Anyone using it
          should be cautious about changing the strategic tasks in any stage as this will potentially have an impact on
          the outcomes of the next.</p>

        <h1><a name="Decisions"></a>Decisions</h1>

        <p>Each Stage identifies the major decisions that should be made before the stage can be completed. These will
          be informed by the activities and information available during the stage. Each project will have its own
          stakeholders to agree those decisions. Identification of the most efficient pathway through the local
          authorities decision processes is a vital part of delivering impactful projects.</p>

        <h1><a name="Themes"></a>Themes</h1>

        <p>Running throughout all the stages are a number of cross cutting features. The Energy projects plan of work
          calls these themes. These are areas that will need to be continuously revisited throughout the development
          lifecycle of the project to ensure successful delivery of a safe, robust and impactful project.</p>

        <h1><a name="Activities"></a>Activities</h1>

        <p>Activities are the areas of focus that should be initiated or developed during a stage. These identify or
          support decisions and are delivered through actions. Each stage has a number of clearly identified activities.
          Each activity has a number of the decisions and actions associated with them.</p>

        <h1><a name="Actions"></a>Actions</h1>

        <p>Clear outcomes should be achieved within an activity. This are presented as a set of actions that can be used
          to review progress during the stage and act as a structure to ensure a robust project. These are also
          referenced within the themes.</p>

        <h1><a name="InformationExchangesanddata"></a>Information Exchanges and data</h1>

        <p>During each stage a large quantity of information will be exchanged between project team members and with
          external stakeholders. A crucial goal at each project stage is to ensure that, at the end of the stage, all
          information required to sign off a stage is captured properly within a set of documentation.</p>

        <p>This serves two purposes.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Information delivered at the end of one stage becomes the basis for the next stage, so it needs to be
            clear at the end of the stage what information will be used by the relevant project team members at the next
            stage.</li>
          <li>Information produced at the end of a stage represents a wide range of decisions, made by the client, that
            will influence how the next stage progresses.</li>
        </ol>


        <p>In early stages this may be captured in the business case but the supporting data, information and documents
          are important to capture and share as these may impact later stages, especially with respect to design.</p>

        <p>Information exchanges may range from the agreement of the Procurement Strategy and determination of the
          Information Requirements, to decisions deriving from Design Reviews by the project team or external
          stakeholders, such as planners.</p>

        <p>It is crucial that the information exchanged at the end of a stage not only includes the information required
          for the next stage, but also records the basis on which this information was determined.</p>

        <h1><a name="SkillsandCapability"></a>Skills and Capability</h1>

        <p>The capability to deliver each stage is dependant on having the right skills available at the right time. The
          plan of work gives a high level overview of the required expertise for each stage and activity.</p>

        <h1><a name="Resources"></a>Resources</h1>

        <p>The plan of work identifies potentially useful resources that will support the project team in creating
          robust projects. These are split into those capturing or supporting good practice or emerging best practice.

        <p><b>Summary</b></p>

        <p><b>Negotiated procedures with prior publication</b> is a procurement route where contracting body does not
          need to carry out a competitive process.</p>

        <p>There are three major cases where the use of <b>negotiated procedures without prior publication</b> might
          justified for public service contracts. (The Public Contracts Regulations 2015)</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Where no tenders, suitable tenders, requests to participate or no suitable requests to participate have
            been submitted in response to an open procedure or a restricted procedure</li>
          <li>Where the works, supplies or services can only be supplied by one supplier because competition is absent
            for technical reasons or the protection of exclusive rights, including intellectual property rights, make a
            competition not possible</li>
          <li>Where there are reasons of extreme urgency, brought about by events unforeseeable by the contracting
            authority, and time limits for other procurement routes cannot be complied with. (eg natural disasters,
            pandemic)</li>
        </ul>


        <p>There are additional cases that may apply to local energy projects.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>where the products involved are manufactured purely for the purpose of research, experimentation, study or
            development,</li>
          <li>additional deliveries by the original supplier which are intended either as a partial replacement of
            supplies or installations or as the extension of existing supplies or installations</li>
          <li>for the purchase of supplies or services on particularly advantageous terms, from either a supplier which
            is definitively winding up its business activities, or the liquidator in an insolvency procedure, an
            arrangement with creditors, or a similar procedure under national laws or regulations.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>If a previous procurement has been through a design contest then the use <b>negotiated procedures without
            prior publication</b> may be used to procure the winner(s) of the design contest.</p>

        <p>All projects require funding in some way. In most situations, money (capital) needs to be provided in order

          important when starting a project to have the necessary funds available or obtain a guarantee that they will
          be available when needed to progress the project through its lifecycle.</p>

        <p>The funding and investment options activity is where the strategy for the project is developed and options

        <h2><a name="Projectfunding"></a>Project funding</h2>

        <p>Funding for projects may be via a single source or through multiple investors. The governance of the project
          will vary to meet the needs of the investors in the project and the lifecycle option chosen.</p>

        <p>Projects can be funded internally by the organisation or externally through things like grants, loans, joint
          ventures or other mechanisms such as a private finance initiative (PFI) or public private partnerships (PPP).
          It would be wrong, if not illegal, to commence any project without appropriate funding in place.</p>

        <p>Project funding and investment is different to the project budget, which refers to the resources required to
          deliver a project. For some stages the funding or investment may cover the budget costs.</p>

        <h2><a name="Investmentdecisions"></a>Investment decisions</h2>

        <p>The&nbsp;<b>investment appraisal</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;business case&nbsp;for the project or programme depends on
          attribution of benefits at the right level. The business case brings together the investment appraisal for the
          project, programme or portfolio, with a wider evidence-based narrative of how the investment is intended to
          lead to realisation of the intended qualitative and quantitative benefits.</p>

        <p>It is normal to compare options using an investment appraisal that considers the trade-off between whole-life
          costs, benefits and deployment risks to determine the best-value option.</p>

        <p>The time taken to deliver projects can vary enormously, from weeks to many years. In addition, the time taken
          to realise the benefit from a project can again vary enormously. If the project is to take place over multiple
          years, the time value of money, in other words the concept that the money is worth more now than in the
          future, needs to be considered</p>

        <h3><a name="1.IsthecontractvaluebelowThreshold%3F"></a>1. Is the contract value below Threshold?</h3>

        <p>Thresholds will depend on the sector and type of service contracted. If the contract value is below the
          threshold a public body is not required to procure through a tendering process.</p>

        <p>It is advised to engage with the legal team to identify which threshold category (public contracts, utility
          contracts, concession contracts, or defence and security contracts) applies to procured services or goods.</p>

        <h3><a
            name="2.Areyourrequirementspartofspecialcircumstancesintermsofurgency%2Cpatents%2Corunsuitabilityofbidsreceivedinaprevioustenderingprocess%3F"></a>2.
          Are your requirements part of special circumstances in terms of urgency, patents, or unsuitability of bids
          received in a previous tendering process?</h3>

        <p>The use of negotiated procedures without prior publication needs always to be justified when the contract
          value overcome the relevant threshold. There are only three major cases where there might be a justification.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>The contracting authority has received none or not-suitable requests to participate in previous Open or
            Restricted tender.</li>
          <li>The contracting authority has certainty that only one supplier can meet the requirements for technical
            reasons, artistic reasons, or intellectual property rights (e.g. patented solutions).</li>
          <li>The requirement is extremely urgent and unforeseeable (e.g. natural disasters).</li>
        </ul>


        <h3><a name="3.Doyouhaveadefinitionforthedesiredoutcomeordesignidea%3F"></a>3. Do you have a definition for the
          desired outcome or design idea?</h3>

        <p>In case the contracting authority does not have a clear idea of what the requirements are to achieve the
          desired outcome, a design contest can help formulate the requirements for the solution to be procured.</p>

        <h3><a name="4.Aretherequirementscomplexornotfullydefinable%3F"></a>4. Are the requirements complex or not fully
          definable?</h3>

        <p>This question refers to the possibility of using off-the-shelf products or in general solutions that are
          widely available in the market without the need for the supplier to significantly customise their offer.</p>



        <h3><a name="4.1.IsthereaframeworkorDPSthatmeetsyourrequirements%3F"></a>4.1 . Is there a framework or DPS that
          meets your requirements?</h3>

        <p>In case of a negative answer to question 4, It is always advisable to look for an existing framework or DPS.
          Our team has put together a list of existing frameworks and DPS (some others may exist) that a local authority
          can consult.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3><a name="4.2.Canyouchangeyourrequirementstofitintoanexistingframework%3F"></a>4.2. Can you change your
          requirements to fit into an existing framework?</h3>

        <p>Frameworks and DPS can save a considerable amount of time and cost in the procurement process. If you have
          identified a framework or DPS that could suit your case with minor changes to your requirements, you should
          consider this possibility.</p>

        <h3><a name="4.3.Istherearecurringrequirementforaproductorservice%3F"></a>4.3. Is there a recurring requirement
          for a product or service?</h3>

        <p>If the contracting authority expects to procure the product or service periodically, setting up a framework
          or DPS could save time and cost in the long term.</p>

        <h3><a name="4.4.Doyouexpectasmallnumberoforganisationswitharelativelysimpleawardprocess%3F"></a>4.4. Do you
          expect a small number of organisations with a relatively simple award process?</h3>

        <p>An open procedure is simpler and faster compared to other competitive tendering processing. Therefore, this
          procurement route is generally advised when procuring off-the-shelf solutions.</p>

        <p>However, reviewing a large number of tenders can create huge overheads for the contracting authority. Through
          a restricted procedure the contracting authority can filter the suppliers invited to tender based on their
          financial standing and technical and professional capability.</p>

        <p>During the market engagement phase, the contracting authority should gain insight into the number of
          potential suppliers in the market and the potential complexity (or simplicity) of the award process.</p>

        <h3><a name="5.Doyouhavewelldefinedrequirementsthatmatchthemarketofferings%3F"></a>5. Do you have well-defined
          requirements that match the market offerings?</h3>

        <p>If the contracting authority is able to properly define all the technical (and other) requirements without
          the need for negotiation or dialogue with the potential bidders, then the answer to this question should be
          “yes”, leading to a restricted procedure.</p>

        <h3><a
            name="6.Isthesolutionsonovelthatnocurrentmarketofferingexistandthereistheneedforadiscoveryphase%3F"></a>6.
          Is the solution so novel that no current market offering exist and there is the need for a discovery phase?
        </h3>

        <p>During the market engagement phase, the contracting authority should understand if the current market
          offering can deliver the solution they want to procure. In case there was nothing on the market that could
          satisfy the requirements of the contracting authority, an innovation partnership would be an option to
          explore.</p>

        <p>This procurement route consists of running several R&amp;D mini-competitions. After each of them, the
          contracting authority has the option to terminate the partnership, reduce the number of partners, or award a
          contract. Therefore, this route is advised for extremely innovative solutions.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3><a name="6.1.Doyouwanttheoptiontomakeanawardwithoutnegotiation%3F"></a>6.1. Do you want the option to make
          an award without negotiation?</h3>

        <p>The main difference between a competitve dialogue and competitve procedure with negotiation is the
          possibility to avoid negotiation, in case the contracting authority is satisfied with the initial proposal
          received (sent before dialogue or negotiation). This can expedite the procurement process. More details on the
          difference between these two procurement procedures are given at the bottom of their description page.</p>

        <p>📤 The primary outcome from this activity is to understand the potential routes for procuring a solution</p>

        <p>The procurement strategy also develops the role of the local authority in delivering the solution. For

        <p>The procurement strategy lays out how each plan of work stage will be procured, what teams will be
          responsible for managing and delivering each stage and what procurement process will need to be followed to
          deliver the outcomes.</p>

        <p>The procurement process continues through the lifecycle of the project, from engaging the market to contract
          management.</p>

        <p>Procurement needs to be considered from an early stage in a project as it has a fundamental impact on how a
          project is organised. </p>

        <p>The Procurement Plan influences: </p>

        <ul>
          <li>How the Project Programme is structured and how it manages risk</li>
          <li>Who is contractually responsible for Project Risks</li>
          <li>Who is responsible for the design and when specialists become involved in the design work</li>
          <li>How and when the design team is employed</li>
          <li>How the construction/installation teams are appointed and when their involvement can start</li>
          <li>How the operational phase will be managed</li>
        </ul>


        <p>The choice of Procurement Plan does not fundamentally alter the design process during Stages 2 and 3 other
          than potentially including contractors in the concept design phase. However, the information that will be
          produced at each stage needs to be carefully considered to ensure the best value is delivered by the
          contracted design and implementation teams. </p>

        <h3><a name="Thingstoconsider"></a>Things to consider</h3>

        <p>✅ Ensure a comprehensive set of information for each stage and tendering</p>

        <p>✅ Lock down key aspects of the design critical to the quality of the outcome before tendering at the right
          time with detailed information</p>

        <p>✅ Ensure coordination between the different project teams</p>

        <p>✅ Consider procurement outcomes rather than services or products. This allows bidders to present their best
          solution rather than be constrained by previous assumptions</p>

        <h3><a name="ProcuringOutcomes"></a>Procuring Outcomes</h3>

        <p><em>derived from (Government Outcomes Lab, 2021)</em></p>

        <p>There are a range of&nbsp;ways in which&nbsp;an&nbsp;outcomes&nbsp;orientation&nbsp;can be incorporated into
          public services,&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;focus on the overall improvements in the life of service users, rather
          than&nbsp;participation in individual services.&nbsp;Outcomes-based contracting&nbsp;is one way of achieving
          this,&nbsp;by linking&nbsp;payments directly to the achievement of outcomes with service users.&nbsp; </p>

        <p>Outcomes-based contracting,&nbsp;through&nbsp;which payments are linked to the achievement of outcomes, sits
          in a broader range of public service sourcing strategies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <ul>
          <li>In-house service delivery&nbsp;or&nbsp;grant funding&nbsp;to external provider organisations focuses
            payment on&nbsp;inputs,&nbsp;including financial resources and staffing.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Fee-for-service&nbsp;contracts pay providers to&nbsp;deliver a specified&nbsp;activity&nbsp;to
            users.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Results-based financing&nbsp;(RBF)&nbsp;approaches tie payment to&nbsp;the achievement of pre-specified
            objectives. In some forms&nbsp;of RBF, payment is tied to&nbsp;outputs, such as completion of an
            activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Outcomes-based contracting&nbsp;is a form of RBF.&nbsp;Payments are linked to the achievement
            of&nbsp;specified&nbsp;outcomes.&nbsp;Impact bonds&nbsp;are a subset of outcomes-based contracts,
            in&nbsp;which private investors provide the upfront capital to cover service delivery costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </li>
        </ul>


        <h3><a name="PrinciplesforProcuringbetteroutcomes"></a>Principles for Procuring better outcomes </h3>

        <p>derived from (<em>Ten Principles for Procuring Better Outcomes</em>, 2016)</p>

        <p>These principles are aimed at construction projects, but are relevant to local energy projects.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Invest in the right design skills, briefing and design process at the right stage when setting project
            budgets</li>
          <li>Consider whether and how the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 apply when commissioning design services -
            This is a given in the public sector</li>
          <li>Select and tailor your procurement procedure to suit your project needs, using design quality as a means
            to shortlist or award contracts where appropriate</li>
          <li>Consider whether a framework will deliver the best outcomes and design quality for the full range of
            projects you intend to procure. If awarding frameworks, consider dividing them into more numerous and
            smaller lots</li>
          <li>Consider actively encouraging consortia bids from smaller businesses, making it as simple as possible for
            consortia to compete</li>
          <li>Make the selection phase as simple as possible and proportionate to the scale and complexity of your
            project</li>
          <li>When assessing consultant capability, consider a track record of undertaking projects of a similar scale
            and complexity rather than extensive previous experience of an identical project type</li>
          <li>Set out your evaluation criteria for both selection and award stages clearly in advance, and balance
            quantitative (fees and cost) with qualitative criteria, using a qualified design assessor</li>
          <li>Establish financial thresholds based on the scale, complexity, actual level of risk and value of the
            design services – turnover and Professional Indemnity Insurance requirements are not mandatory criteria
            although the local authorities local procurement policy may mandate certain thresholds.</li>
          <li>Choose a standard form of contract, if they exist, and consultant appointment that promotes collaboration,
            integration and direct communication with your design team.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In case a local authority needs to purchase work, goods or services from an amount that is higher than the
          applicable <b>Threshold</b>, it will need to follow one of the following procurement procedures. Consult our
          decision-making tree for an initial guideline on what needs to be considered when choosing a procurement
          procedure.</p>

        <h4><a name="Negotiatedprocedurewithoutpriorpublication"></a>Negotiated procedure without prior publication</h4>

        <p>The use of “negotiated procedures without prior publication” needs always to be justified when the contract
          value overcome the relevant threshold</p>

        <h4><a name="Designcontests"></a>Design contests</h4>

        <p>A means a procurement procedure for obtaining competitive tenders for services which are creative in nature
          and which require that part of the services be carried as part of the tender to facilitate the evaluation of
          the tenders and such services.</p>

        <h4><a name="OpenProcedure"></a>Open Procedure</h4>

        <p>An Open procedure means that any organisation can respond to the advertised Contract Notice, request/download
          the procurement documents and submit a tender. All tenders must be evaluated in line with the methodology and
          criteria set out in the procurement documents</p>

        <h4><a name="Restrictedprocedure"></a>Restricted procedure</h4>

        <p>A restricted procedure is a procurement route in which any supplier wishing to become a candidate need to
          request to participate. Only those qualified candidates invited by the contracting authority can submit a
          tender.</p>

        <h4><a name="CompetitiveProcedurewithNegotiation"></a>Competitive Procedure with Negotiation</h4>

        <p>The competitive procedure with negotiation is similar to the competitive dialogue, however, the competitive
          procedure with negotiation allows the contracting authority flexibility around whether to negotiate - it is
          possible to reserve the right…not to negotiate and to simply award the contract based on initial tenders
          submitted.</p>

        <h4><a name="Competitivedialogueprocedure"></a>Competitive dialogue procedure</h4>

        <p>Competitive dialogue is a specific legislative procurement route which allows departments (contracting
          authorities) to hold dialogue with bidders on various aspects of the procurement.</p>

        <h4><a name="Innovationpartnershipsprocedure"></a>Innovation partnerships procedure</h4>

        <p>An innovation partnership is a procurement process combined with an R&amp;D contract.</p>

                  Before developing a business case, it is crucial for a local authority to assess the market. This
                  consists of conducting an intelligence study, to gain a good overview of the current state of the
                  technology or service that will be procured, important trends, and factors driving the cost. The
                  ultimate scope of this assessment is to become an “intelligent customer”. <br>
                  There are several activities that can be carried out to assess the market.<br>
                  <b>Some examples are:</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>engaging with potential suppliers of the service or technology provided,</li>
                    <li>participating in conferences,</li>
                    <li>issuing market surveys,</li>
                    <li>collecting case studies, and</li>
                    <li>desktop research.<br>
                      Additionally, <b>it is advised to engage with other local authorities that have tried to reach or
                        that are trying to reach a similar outcome.</b> <br>
                      You should be asking the following questions: <em>derived from (Crown Commercial Service,
                        2017)</em><br>
                      ❓ When do your contracts end and can you extend them? <br>
                      ❓ What are the strengths and weaknesses of the current service? <br>
                      ❓ What are your key drivers? What are your objectives? <br>
                      ❓ Do you have a procurement strategy in place? How does it fit with your other strategies? <br>
                      ❓ How long should the contract be? <br>
                      ❓ What type of contract should you have? <br>
                      ❓ What is the scope of work? <br>
                      ❓ Have you got the internal resources to deliver this? <br>
                      ❓ What timetable are you working to? What are your key milestones?” <br>
                      This will allow a local authority to further shape the specification, gather ideas on new
                      innovative products and understand if there are any changes within the market that may influence
                      the requirements.<br>
                      <b>Some good practise during market engagement are:</b> <br>
                      ✅ Contact all suppliers from your shortlist <br>
                      ✅ Provide a reasonable time limit to email requests and to make sure suppliers know when they need
                      to respond by.<br>
                      ✅ Keep an audit trail of all communication<br>
                      ✅ Do not limit contact to suppliers that you know <br>
                      ✅ Avoid contacting suppliers in different ways; each supplier should be given an equal opportunity
                      to respond (i.e. don’t email some suppliers and phone others to discuss your requirements) <br>
                      ✅ Do not forget that all suppliers can bid when you issue your final specification

          the procurement team has set internal Thresholds and procedures for contracts that are below central

        <p>The central government Thresholds from January 2021 are presented in the following tables (Thresholds are

        <p>These are planning tools that can be used to secure financial and non-financial contributions (including
          affordable housing), or other works, to provide infrastructure to support the development and mitigate the
          impact of development.</p>

        <p>They can be used to help deliver infrastructure to support the development of a local area. In addition, some
          areas have developed carbon offsetting payments which may be pooled and used to fund low/zero carbon projects.
        </p>

        <p><b>Planning obligations</b></p>

        <p>Planning obligations are legal obligations entered into to mitigate the impacts of a development proposal.
        </p>

        <p>This can be via a planning agreement entered into under&nbsp;section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act
          1990&nbsp;by a person with an interest in the land and the local planning authority; or via a unilateral
          undertaking entered into by a person with an interest in the land without the local planning authority.</p>

        <p>Planning obligations run with the land, are legally binding and enforceable. A unilateral undertaking cannot
          bind the local planning authority because they are not party to it.</p>

        <p>Planning obligations are also commonly referred to as ‘section 106’, ‘s106’, as well as ‘developer
          contributions’ when considered alongside highways contributions and the Community Infrastructure Levy.
          (Department for Levelling Up, 2016)</p>

        <p><b>Community Infrastructure Levy</b></p>

        <p>The Community Infrastructure Levy is a charge which can be levied by local authorities on new development in
          their area. It is an important tool for local authorities to use to help them deliver the infrastructure
          needed to support development in their area.</p>

        <p>The levy only applies in areas where a local authority has consulted on, and approved, a charging schedule
          which sets out its levy rates and has published the schedule on its website.</p>

        <p>The Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) regulations require all local planning authorities that issue
          a&nbsp;CIL&nbsp;liability notice or enter into section 106 planning obligations during a reporting year to
          publish an infrastructure funding statement (IFS) at least annually. The infrastructure funding statement
          should, as a minimum, include the information set out in&nbsp;Schedule 2 to the Community Infrastructure Levy
          regulations 2010&nbsp;(as inserted by the 2019 regulations). (Department for Levelling Up, and Housing &amp;

        <p>Contract or receivable contract funding can be beneficial to local energy projects where the upfront cost
          will be captured in revenue once the project is operational. They can release a cash lump sum at the start of
          the contract to help fund future contracts partially or in full. They can facilitate deferred or extended
          payments term again assisting with cash flow through the lifecycle of a project</p>

        </h2>

        <p>Accounts receivable financing is similar to a traditional loan. A typical loan requires that the local
          authority present tangible assets (such as property), accounts receivable financing places the local
          authorities account receivables as collateral. Simply put, it is a type of asset-based lending which helps to
          clear the invoices.</p>

        <h2><a name="ContractFinancing%C2%A0"></a>Contract Financing&nbsp;</h2>

        <p>Contract financing is a way for the local authorities to receive revenue in advance for work yet to be done
          in a local energy project. A legal contract binds the agreement between the local authority and the customer.
          The contract stipulates the milestones and payments based on overall progress in the project. </p>

        <p>Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are long term contracts where the project functions (operations,
          financing, construction etc) are transferred to the private firm. Private funds will finance government
          projects in the short term whereas profits are usually drawn from taxpayers in the longer term. For example,
          this has been the business model used to finance new hospitals in recent years.</p>

        <p>This content is derived from the Topic Guide Public Private Partnerships (Nathan Associates, 2017)</p>

        <p>Advocates generally argue that PPPs enable the public sector to harness the expertise and efficiencies that
          the private sector can bring to the delivery of certain facilities and services traditionally procured and
          delivered by the public sector. On the other hand, critics suggest that PPPs are part of an ideological
          program that seeks to privatize public services for the profits of private entities.</p>

        <p>When appropriate and implemented well, PPPs can bolster economic growth, unlock revenue potential and enhance
          innovation and operational efficiency in the provision of public services.</p>

        <p>There are a couple of main types of Public Private Partnerships.</p>

        <p><b>Demand risk PPPs</b> where the private sector concessionaire receives payment directly from the users of
          the infrastructure (for example through user tolls) rather than from the local government. In these cases, the
          private sector operator is taking on the demand risk associated with the infrastructure and the infrastructure
          is being funded by users rather than the local authority.</p>

        <p><b>Availability payment-based PPPs</b> where the local government agrees to make payments to the private
          sector operator of the infrastructure based on key performance indicators being satisfied. In these PPPs, the
          local authority takes on the demand risk. Availability payment-based PPPs typically include social
          infrastructure PPPs, such as those in healthcare, education and justice.</p>

        <p>PPP arrangements can range across a wide range of project and contracting scopes. The diagram below outlines
          how these may manifest in terms of timescales </p>



        <p><span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="./KBA export (JIRA)_files/image-20220122-150519.png" height="747"
              width="976" style="border: 0px solid black"></span></p>

        <p>PPPs are arrangements that require significant input from both the public and private sectors. Although the
          private sector may construct and own an infrastructure asset, the public sector still has a large role to play
          throughout the process of a PPP project, particularly in the project preparation phases. </p>

        <p>The various responsibilities typically undertaken by the public and private sectors during a PPP arrangement
          are outlined below: </p>

        <h3><a name="Publicsectorrole"></a>Public sector role</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Establish project objectives</li>
          <li>Accountability to citizens</li>
          <li>Project identification, assessment and prioritisation</li>
          <li>Project preparation (including feasibility studies, value for money analyses and the review of unsolicited
            proposals)</li>
          <li>Pursue a market oriented approach (consult stakeholders during all stages of PPP cycle)</li>
          <li>Project tendering and selection (including the hiring of advisors, drafting the contract, selecting the
            winning bidder, ensuring that proper financing and insurance have been obtained)</li>
          <li>Project monitoring (monitoring contract compliance)</li>
        </ul>


        <h3><a name="Privatesectorrole"></a>Private sector role </h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Ensure financial and technical capacity throughout all phases of the project (project preparation,
            selection, monitoring)</li>
          <li>Compete in bidding process fairly and offer the government an optimal value for money</li>
          <li>Ensure services provided comply with the contract and remain in line with the quality expected by users
          </li>
          <li>Sharing expertise and know-how with the public sector to build wider institutional capacity</li>
          <li>In certain roles, the private sector may also act as a transaction advisor and advise the public sector on
            how to tender and structure a project.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3><a name="KeystoSuccess"></a>Keys to Success </h3>

        <p>In order to ensure success in PPPs and reduce risk to both local authorities and the private partners it is
          important to create rigorous project definitions and governance structures.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Set realistic expectations and clear objectives for the project</li>
          <li>Ensure value for money for the government</li>
          <li>Maintain benefits for the greater public interest</li>
          <li>Ensure transparency</li>
          <li>Allow for adequate access to information for all stakeholders</li>
          <li>Ensure accountability Promote competition</li>
          <li>Ensure a proper balance and allocation of risks and rewards</li>
          <li>Must support environmental and social protection</li>
        </ul>


        <h3><a name="ExamplesofPublicPrivatePartnerships"></a>Examples of Public Private Partnerships</h3>

        <h4><a name="JointVentures%28JVs%29"></a>Joint Ventures (JVs)</h4>

        <p>A Joint Venture offers different possible arrangements with each partner contributing resources (e.g. land,
          capital, intellectual property, experienced staff, and equipment) to the venture. As a result, the risks and
          benefits associated with the venture are shared between the entities involved. (Midlands Energy Hub, 2021)</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Contractual partnering and concession arrangements with no corporate status.</li>
          <li>Non-profit-distributing e.g. company limited by guarantee (CLG) and industrial and provident societies
            (IPSs).</li>
          <li>Community Interest Company (CIC) structure</li>
          <li>Company limited by shares (CLS)</li>
          <li>Limited Partnership (LP)</li>
          <li>Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)</li>
        </ul>


        <p>Regardless of the specific PPP model, private investors are interested in aggregating projects to reach scale
          (e.g. £1-5 million per portfolio). To aggregate projects, there is the need for standardised documentation
          (investor memoranda, contracts, procurement documentation, etc…) and collaboration between local authorities
          to collate similar projects. The standardisation of the documentation is key to lower the transaction costs
          for portfolios consisting of several small aggregated projects.</p>

        <h4><a name="EnergyServiceCompanies"></a>Energy Service Companies</h4>

        <p>Investors and project developers can sign partnerships, such as Energy Service Companies (ESCos), to create
          pipelines of investable projects backed up by standardised documentation. In this case, the project developer
          acts as an intermediary between the local authority and the ESCo. A similar approach is the establishment of a
          regional ESCo that operates across multiple local authorities to collate pipelines of similar projects that
          can easily be aggregated.</p>

        <p>Energy as a service agreements (EaaS) are a financing delivery model that combines not only hardware and
          software but also services.</p>

        <p>The Energy-as-a-Service approach shifts from asset-focussed, centralised power generation and the sale of it
          to passive consumers. Instead, it offers end-to-end management of a customer’s energy assets and services.</p>

        <p>By combining the client’s resources into a large ‘smart energy community’, EaaS providers can merge markets,
          offer predictable load balancing and upgrade the grid in a number of different ways.</p>

        <p>Under an Energy-as-a-service contract, a local authority pays for a service (e.g. hours of light) to an
          Energy Service Company (ESCo).</p>

        </ul>




        <p>In this case, the local authority does not carry any risk. Therefore, this model can be more expensive than
          other financing options. Under this model, the service provider is responsible for engaging with private
          investors to secure funds.</p>

        <p>(Deloitte, 2019)</p>



        <p><b>Derived from (E3P, 2016)</b></p>

        <p>An ESCO is a company that offers energy services which may include implementing energy-efficiency projects
          (and also renewable energy projects) and in many case on a turn-key basis. The three main characteristics of
          an ESCO are:&nbsp;</p>

        <ul>
          <li>ESCOs guarantee energy savings and/or provision of the same level of energy service at lower cost. A
            performance guarantee can take several forms. It can revolve around the actual flow of energy savings from a
            project, can stipulate that the energy savings will be sufficient to repay monthly debt service costs, or
            that the same level of energy service is provided for less money.</li>
          <li>The remuneration of ESCOs is directly tied to the energy savings achieved;</li>
          <li>ESCOs can finance, or assist in arranging financing for the operation of an energy system by providing a
            savings guarantee.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>Therefore ESCOs accept some degree of risk for the achievement of improved energy efficiency in a user’s
          facility and have their payment for the services delivered based (either in whole or at least in part) on the
          achievement of those energy efficiency improvements.</p>

        <p>Another category of companies that offer energy services to final energy users, including the supply and
          installation of energy-efficient equipment, the supply of energy, and/or building refurbishment, maintenance
          and operation, facility management, and the supply of energy (including heat), are&nbsp;<b>Energy Service
            Provider Companies (ESPCs)</b><em>.</em>&nbsp;They may be consultants specialised in efficiency
          improvements, equipment manufacturers or utilities. ESPCs provide a service for a fixed fee or as added value
          to the supply of equipment. ESPC may have some incentives to reduce consumption, but these are not as clear as
          in the ESCO approach. Often the full cost of energy services is recovered in the fee, so the ESPC does not
          assume any risk in case of underperformance. EPSC is paid a fee for their advice or equipment rather than
          being paid based on the results of their recommendations.</p>

        <h3><a name="%C2%A0ESCOprojectelements"></a>&nbsp;ESCO project elements</h3>

        <p>The typical ESCO project includes the following elements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Site survey and preliminary evaluation;</li>
          <li>Investment grade energy audit;</li>
          <li>Identification of possible energy saving and efficiency improving actions;</li>
          <li>Financial presentation and client decision;</li>
          <li>Guarantee of the results by proper contract clauses;</li>
          <li>Project financing;</li>
          <li>Comprehensive engineering and project design and specifications;</li>
          <li>Procurement and installation of equipment; final design and construction;</li>
          <li>Project management, commissioning and acceptance;</li>
          <li>Facility and equipment operation &amp; maintenance for the contract period;</li>
          <li>Purchase of fuel &amp; electricity (to provide heat, comfort, light, etc.);</li>
          <li>Measurement and verifications of the savings results;</li>
          <li>Operation and maintenance.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3><a name="InvestmentGradeAudit"></a>Investment Grade Audit</h3>

        <p>The Investment Grade Audit (IGA) deserves special attention. The traditional energy audit does not
          sufficiently consider how implemented measures will behave over time. An IGA builds on the conventional energy
          audit because auditors must consider the conditions under which measures will function during the life of the
          project. Unlike the traditional energy audit, which assumes that all conditions (related to e.g. system,
          payback, people) remain the same over time, IGA attempts to more accurately predict a building's future energy
          use by adding the dimension of a ‘risk assessment component’ which evaluates conditions in a specific building
          and/or processes. Aspect of the IGA, including risk management, the “people” factor, measurement and
          verification, financing issues, report presentation guidelines, and master planning strategies.</p>

        <p>An IGA should therefore serve as a financial investment guide as to how the physical assets of an
          organization can be improved.</p>

        <p>This procedure is available where the contracting authority has identified the need for an innovative
          product, service or works and wishes to appoint a supplier to carry out the development work. Provided it
          meets the contracting authority’s needs and is within the maximum price set, the contracting authority may
          purchase the resulting products, services or works without further competition. </p>

        <p>In other words, the procedure allows for a further phase after the research and development phase where the
          contracting authority can select one or more of the suppliers to provide the goods, works or services. (Green
          Paper: Transforming public procurement, 2020)</p>

        <p>An innovation partnership is essentially a procurement process combined with an R&amp;D contract. Authorities
          are then able to purchase the ‘end result’ of the R&amp;D exercise, without having to undergo a new
          procurement procedure. Authorities may choose to appoint a number of partners to participate in the R&amp;D
          phase, but may subsequently only purchase one/some of those solutions. (Connected Places Catapult, 2019)</p>

        <p>An Innovation partnership can procure a contract for R&amp;D services following a fairly simple procurement
          procedure, this can be more attractive than <b>Competitive Procedure with Negotiation</b> or <b>Competitive
            Dialogue</b> although the same results could be achieved with these routes also, if with more complexity.
        </p>

        <h2><a name="TheInnovationPartnershipisbestusedwhere%3A"></a>The Innovation Partnership is best used where:</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><em>a solution to a ‘problem’ is required;</em></li>
          <li><em>the authority does not have the budget to fund the entirety of the research required to investigate
              potential solutions on its own or appoint a third party to do this; and/or</em></li>
          <li><em>the authority wishes to retain the flexibility to explore a solution(s) in more detail (including
              potentially working with the supplier(s) as part of the R&amp;D phase) before awarding a contract to
              purchase the goods, services or works.</em></li>
        </ul>


        <p>✅ Separates R&amp;D phase from subsequent solution procurement, although the Authority retains the option to
          purchase the end result.</p>

        <p>✅ Can help manage risks around engaging with SMEs and start ups as there is no commitment to purchase the
          product or solution that is the outcome of the R&amp;D</p>

        <p>There are two types of existing EPC models.</p>

        <h3><a name="EPCwithguaranteedsavingsmodel"></a>EPC with guaranteed savings model</h3>

        <p>Under this scheme, the local authority is the contracting party of debt-based funding such as SALIX loans and
          PWLBs. The ESCo will deliver the project, providing a guarantee on the returns achieved through the
          implemented measures. The savings are used to pay back the loan and the ESCo. This means that the local
          authority continues to pay the amount that corresponds to the energy expenditures prior to the implementation
          of the measures. Once the project is fully paid back, the local authority experiences the full amount of
          savings.</p>

        <h3><a name="EPCwithsharedsavingsmodel"></a>EPC with shared savings model</h3>

        <p>With an EPC shared savings model, the ESCo is the contracting party for debt-based funding. Similarly to the
          previous model, the local authority will pay back the project through energy savings. However, under this
          model there is the possibility for the transaction to be off-balance sheet. This means that the deal closes
          faster and that the EPC does not affect the capability of the LA of borrowing other loans. Additionally, this
          model incentivises the ESCo to deliver more energy savings.</p>

        <p>❓ This procurement route is most commonly used when It is not possible to define and specify how the project
          will be delivered and how the contract and the commercial deal will be structured (Government Commercial
          Function, 2021)</p>

        <p>⏲️ In most cases, the dialogue can take up to 18 months. However, the dialogue for very complex projects with
          an extensive budget can take years</p>

      <td class="customfield_12982">
        <p>The Competitive Dialogue procedure is best used where Prior negotiation is needed due to the nature or the
          complexity of the requirement or the legal and financial make-up and/or risks. The procurement is complex
          since multiple solutions must be discussed with bidders before a formal tendering process can commence.

        <p>❌ Increased timescales of over other procurement routes</p>

        <p>Equity finance investment in the corporate sector (venture capital, private equity, business angels, crowd
          funding) is important to allow firms to fund firm level innovation and growth. Equity finance is key for
          economic development. (BEIS, 2019). For local authorities equity finance can support building new assets and
          infrastructure projects.</p>

        <p>Some advantages of using equity are:</p>

        <p>✅ <b>Less burden:</b> With equity financing, there is no loan to repay, which is particularly important when
          the project has no revenue-generation mechanism.</p>

        <p>✅ <b>Lack of credit issues:</b> If the local government lacks credit worthiness, equity can be preferable or
          more suitable than debt financing.</p>

        <p>✅ <b>Learn and gain from partners:</b> Equity creates new partnerships and connections.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;On the other hand, equity financing also presents the following risks:</p>

        <p>❌ <b>Share profit</b>: Investors will expect to have a share of the profit. However, it could be a worthwhile
          trade-off if you are benefiting from the value they bring as financial backers and/or their business acumen
          and experience.</p>

        <p>❌ <b>Share control:</b> Investors may want to have control on the project.</p>

        <p>❌ <b>Potential conflict:</b> Sharing ownership and having to work with others could lead to some tension and
          even conflict if there are differences in vision, management style and ways of running the business.</p>

        <h2><a name="TypesofEquity"></a>Types of Equity</h2>

        <h3><a name="VentureCapital"></a>Venture Capital</h3>

        <p>Venture capital is a form of private equity and a type of financing that investors provide to a borrower
          which is believed to have a long-term growth potential. In some cases investors may not be focused on profits
          but rather in making investments for social good, in which case this is venture philanthropy. This is a form
          of impact investment, i.e. the aim is to generate positive social or environmental effects whilst investing
          for financial gain (note this can be accomplished through more than private equity, it can also be debt or
          through fixed-income securities).</p>

        <h3><a name="PrivateEquity"></a>Private Equity</h3>

        <p>Private equity is an alternative investment class and consists of capital that is not listed on a public
          exchange. Private equity is composed of funds and investors that directly invest in private companies, or that
          engage in buyouts of public companies, resulting in the delisting of public equity. Institutional and retail
          investors provide the capital for private equity, and the capital can be utilized to fund new technology, make
          acquisitions, expand working capital, and to bolster and solidify a balance sheet.</p>

        <h3><a name="BusinessAngels"></a>Business Angels</h3>

        <p>A business angel is a private individual, often with a high net-worth, and usually with business experience,
          who directly invests part of their assets in new and growing private businesses. Business angels can invest
          individually or as part of a syndicate where one angel typically takes the lead role.</p>

        <p>Besides capital, angel investors provide business management experience, skills and contacts for the
          entrepreneur. Experienced angels also know that they may have to wait for a return on their investment. They
          can, therefore, be a good source of ‘smart and patient’ capital.</p>

        <p>Business angels play an important role in the economy. In many countries, they constitute the second-largest
          source of external funding in newly established ventures, after family and friends. They are increasingly
          important as providers of risk capital and contributors to economic growth and technological advances.
          (European Commission, 2021)</p>

        <h3><a name="Crowdfunding"></a>Crowd funding</h3>

        <p>Crowdfunding is a way of raising money to finance projects and businesses. It enables fundraisers to
          <b>collect money from a large number of people via online platforms</b>.</p>

        <p><span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="./KBA export (JIRA)_files/crowdfunding_0.png"
              alt="crowdfunding.png" style="border: 0px solid black"></span></p>

        <p>Crowdfunding is most often used by startup companies or growing businesses as a way of accessing alternative
          funds. It is an innovative way of sourcing funding for new projects, businesses or ideas.</p>

        <p>It can also be a way of cultivating a community around your offering. By using the power of the online
          community, you can also gain <b>useful market insights and access to new customers.</b>(European Commission,
          2021)</p>

        <p>This procurement route is most commonly used when It is not possible to define and specify how the project
          will be delivered and how the contract and the commercial deal will be structured. The primary difference
          between this route and a <span class="error">[competitive dialogue procedure
            |/wiki/spaces/ETIA/pages/3336044563]</span>is the ability to award at the invitation to submit the initial
          tender stage without the requirement for negotiation. </p>

        <p>⏲️ In most cases, the negotiation can take up to 18 months. However, the negotiation for very complex
          projects with an extensive budget can take years.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="customfield_12999"></td>
      <td class="customfield_12982">
        <p>The competitive procedure with negotiation is similar to the <b>competitive dialogue</b>, however, the
          competitive procedure with negotiation allows the contracting authority flexibility around whether to
          negotiate. It is possible to reserve the right not to negotiate and to simply award the contract based on
          initial tenders submitted. </p>

        <p>When used correctly, both CD and CPN offer significant benefits to authorities and bidders. These benefits
          come from the ability for authorities and bidders to hold discussions during the procurement process. With
          either procedure, a dialogue/negotiation strategy will need to be developed and deployed by the department to
          seek optimal value for money. It should be expected that the bidder will also deploy a strategy to ensure its
          commercial position is maximised, whilst recognising it is subject to competitive tension. (Government
          Commercial Function, 2021)</p>

        <p>The competitive dialogue procedure contains more flexibility around negotiation with the winning bidder
          (provided this does not modify the essential aspects of the contract or procurement or amount to a distortion
          of competition). IIt is not possible to negotiate the following submission of final tenders if a local
          authority is using the <b>competitive procedure with negotiation.</b></p>

        <p><b>There are four variants of competitive procedure with negotiation.</b> </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Competitive Procedure with Negotiation</li>
          <li>Competitive Procedure with Negotiation - with Publication of a Prior Information Notice</li>
          <li>Competitive Procedure with Negotiation - Using a PIN as a Call for Competition</li>
          <li>Competitive Procedure with Negotiation - Urgency</li>
        </ul>


        <p>This page focuses on the general contest. for more information on the variants of this procurement procedure,
          please visit: <a

        </p>

        <p>Similarly to a <span class="error">[*competitive dialogue*|]</span> a Competitive Procedure with Negotiation
          is best used where Prior negotiation is needed due to the nature or the complexity of the requirement or the
          legal and financial make-up and/or risks. The procurement is complex since multiple solutions must be
          discussed with bidders before a formal tendering process can commence (Government Commercial Function, 2021)
        </p>

        <p>However, unlike <span class="error">[*competitive dialogue*|]</span>, in a Competitive Procedure with
          Negotiation, the contracting authority has the option of not negotiating and accepting one of the initial
          offers. Thus, a competitive procedure with negotiation is better used when there is the need for negotiating
          only specific aspects of the tender’s content (e.g. equipment performance).(Government Commercial Function,
          2021)</p>

        <p>✅ Can cut straight to award if negotiation is not required following initial bids</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Selling the land</b> outright to raise upfront capital.</li>
          <li><b>Leasing the land</b> to the private sector to raise capital over time.</li>
          <li>Entering into a <b>joint development agreement</b> with private sector partners where the city provides
            the land (or develop part of the infrastructure), the private partner finances the development (or part of
            it), and then both parties share in the profits in a negotiated ratio.</li>
          <li>Revenue generating infrastructure assets, owned by the LA, can also be <b>sold on a perpetual or limited
              life basis</b> to raise money to reinvest in other infrastructure assets or with a contractual obligation
            to not pay money to the public sector but rather to reinvest in the infrastructure asset to improve public
            services.</li>
          <li>Local authorities can separate land ownership from the right to further develop that land. Then, <b>the
              right to further develop</b> the land can be sold to a private entity.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>Land sales can incentivise sustainable infrastructure development in the absence of wider policy frameworks
          mandating sustainable infrastructure development. Sale of municipally owned land can sustain infrastructure
          finance for a longer period of time. There are various ways that increases in urban land values can be
          captured, but the sale of land or land rights has the advantage of producing revenue quickly and being easier
          to administer than betterment taxes, land re-adjustment schemes, or universal property taxation. </p>

        <p>Moreover, municipally owned urban land is not a static asset. It can be ‘created’ by expanding the urban area
          into rural zones at the urban fringe. A legally empowered, active asset manager can also acquire additional
          land from current users for urban re-development, or for highway and airport construction. It can then re-sell
          part of the land after its value has been enhanced by public investment. Even without public improvements,
          urbanization and economic growth tend to drive up land prices, adding to the value of land held on local
          balance sheets.</p>

        <p>Given the strong impact that an asset sale would have on the municipal balance sheet and representing a
          one-time income flow, a project willing to source finances through this tool has a strong need to demonstrate
          value-for-money.</p>

        <p><img class="emoticon" src="./KBA export (JIRA)_files/warning.png" height="16" width="16" align="absmiddle"
            alt="" border="0"> Land resources are limited and are a one-time income flow. As a general rule, asset sales
          of this kind have been viewed as a temporary financing expedient and fiscal experts have warned cities not to
          become dependent upon asset sales as a significant or continuing source of capital financing.</p>

        <p>✅ Evidence suggests that land leaseholds should be primarily used to leverage new infrastructure assets tied
          to a city’s land use plan to avoid risk of inefficient or underused infrastructure development (e.g.
          development that does not meet local needs or that is not located where potential users are). Leasehold
          frameworks and related revenue stream should be systematically linked to a city’s land use plans. Down the
          line, leaseholds are likely to need to be complemented by taxes and charges to pay for maintenance and
          expansion of infrastructure service provision. (Global Platform for sustainable cities, 2001)</p>

        <p>Taken from (Social Finance, 2018)</p>

        <p>Community businesses looking for financing often need to look beyond the banks and the traditional social
          investment community for funding. The local community, friends and family, digital funding and finance
          platforms are all viable options, but one largely unexplored area has been local authorities. Community
          business’ contribution to place making means that their objectives often naturally align with the mission of
          local authorities – to promote the economic and social well-being of an area through empowering communities,
          and to meet the needs of its residents. This positions councils perfectly to be informed and impactful social
          investors.</p>

        <p>Central government policy not only recognises that local government may have mixed-motives for investment,
          but actively acknowledges that local authorities may have a different risk appetite to other actors investing
          solely for yield. The case studies in this report demonstrate that appetite exists; and, that the municipal
          entrepreneurialism of the past is not only possible, but alive and kicking. It just requires the commitment of
          local champions, the right expertise, and a willingness to take measured risks in partnership with local
          communities and social organisations.</p>

        <p>There are several “tax advantage tools” local governments can use to attract developers of sustainable
          projects.</p>

        <p>Derived from (Global Platform for sustainable cities, 2001)</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Tax holidays:</b> Temporary exemption of a new firm or investment from certain specified taxes,
            typically at least corporate income tax. Sometimes administrative requirements are also waived, notably the
            need to file tax returns.</li>
          <li><b>Special zones:</b> Geographically limited areas in which qualified firms can locate and thus benefit
            from the exemption of varying scope of taxes and/or administrative requirements.</li>
          <li><b>Tax credits:</b> A tax credit is a tax incentive that allows certain taxpayers to subtract the amount
            of the credit from the total they owe the state. Incentive tax credits may be used to encourage behaviours
            like investment or parenting. A credit directly reduces tax bills, unlike tax deductions and tax exemptions,
            which indirectly reduce tax bills by reducing the size of the base (for example, a taxpayer’s income or
            property value) from which the tax bill is calculated. Investment Tax Credits (ITC) and Production Tax
            Credits (PTC) are two commonly used tax credits to stimulate investment in sustainability projects.</li>
          <li><b>Investment tax credit:</b> Deduction of a certain fraction of an investment from the tax liability.
            Rules differ regarding excess credits (credits in excess of tax liability) and include the possibility that
            they may be lost, carried forward or refunded.</li>
          <li><b>Investment allowance:</b> Deduction of a certain fraction of investment from taxable profits (in
            addition to depreciation). The value of an allowance is the product of the allowance and the tax rate.
            Unlike a tax credit, its value will thus vary across firms unless there is a single tax rate. Moreover, the
            value is affected by changes to the tax rate, with a tax cut reducing it. An example of this scheme, in the
            UK, is the “Super Deduction” capital allowance scheme. This will allow deductions on capital allowance on
            qualifying plant and machinery investments, and allowance on special rate assets from 1 April 2021 until 31
            March 2023.</li>
          <li><b>Accelerated depreciation:</b> Depreciation at a faster schedule than available for the rest of the
            economy. This can be implemented in many different ways, including higher first-year depreciation
            allowances, or increased depreciation rates. Tax payments in nominal terms are unaffected, but their net
            present value is reduced and the liquidity of firms is improved.</li>
          <li><b>Product Tax Credits (PTC)</b> is based on the quantity and quality of the product of a sustainable
            project, such as renewable energy generated per year. The government can define the percentage of tax basis
            depending on the technology employed. This method motivates investors to maintain the good performance of
            sustainable projects over time.</li>
          <li><b>Reduced tax rates:</b> Reduction in a tax rate, typically the corporate income tax rate.</li>
          <li><b>Exemptions from various taxes:</b> Exemption from certain taxes, often those collected at the border
            such as tariffs, excises and VAT on imported inputs.</li>
          <li><b>Financing incentives:</b> Reductions in tax rates applying to providers of funds, e.g., reduced
            withholding taxes on dividends.</li>
          <li><b>Accelerated depreciation</b> can have the effect of reducing the developer’s taxable income in earlier
            years and thus provide for a better return on equity investment. The government might issue a taxation
            policy to allow extra amount tax basis to be depreciated.</li>
          <li><b>Retention of business rates in designated economic growth areas</b>, or “Enterprise Zones“. In this
            “Councils retain up to half of the rates revenue raised from businesses in their local area, with the
            remainder retained centrally by the government and used to provide grant funding for local authorities.</li>
          <li><b>Energy Company Obligation funding</b>. Under this “obligated suppliers must mainly promote measures
            which improve the ability of low income, fuel poor and vulnerable households to heat their homes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The most common subsidies used by local governments are:</p>

        <p><b>Producer oriented subsidy:</b> Local government can provide a subsidy to the investor or solution
          provider, such as providing special tariff for using renewable energy;</p>

        <p><b>Consumer-oriented subsidy:</b> The subsidy can be designed to subsidize a behaviour of consumers, for
          example subsidizing purchasing of electric cars” [1]</p>

        <p>This instrument is not sufficient for financing large scale infrastructure projects. Subsidies can
          unnecessarily distort markets, preventing efficient outcomes and diverting resources from more productive uses
          to less productive one in some cases. They can be useful to kickstart a market or sector.</p>

        <p>The open procedure is best used where the requirements are typically straightforward, with a relatively
          simple Selection and Award process; and it is anticipated that only a small number of organisations will
          respond to the advertised Contract Notice.</p>

        <h2><a name="Advantages"></a>Advantages</h2>

        <p>✅ Increased competition due to the potentially high volume of responses </p>

        <p>✅ Organisations of all sizes have the opportunity to submit a tender,</p>

        <p>✅ increasing the opportunity for a number of innovative proposals/solutions </p>

        <p>✅ Advantageous for simple and straightforward requirements (e.g. stationery) </p>

        <p>✅ Providing full tender documentation (at the outset) enables candidates to make an informed decision as to
          whether they can satisfy the requirements, or choose to discount themselves from the competition </p>

        <p>✅ Overall timescale reduced (no pre-qualification stage)</p>

        <h2><a name="Disadvantages"></a>Disadvantages</h2>

        <p>❌ Resource implications of a potentially lengthy tender evaluation (due to a high volume of responses)</p>

        <p>❌ Increases the risk of challenge (more responses and time invested/transaction costs in preparing a tender
          as opposed to a Selection Questionnaire) </p>

        <p>❌ Poor quality bids (due to the fact there is an increased chance of being unsuccessful and a limited
          timescale) </p>

        <p>❌ No opportunity to discuss/refine bids</p>

        <p><b>Sovereign wealth fund</b>&nbsp;(<b>SWF</b>),&nbsp;<b>sovereign investment fund</b>, or&nbsp;<b>social
            wealth fund</b>&nbsp;is a state-owned&nbsp;investment fund&nbsp;that invests in real and financial assets

          as&nbsp;private equity fund&nbsp;or&nbsp;hedge funds.</p>

        <p>Sovereign wealth funds invest globally. Most SWFs are funded by revenues from commodity exports or
          from&nbsp;foreign-exchange reserves&nbsp;held by the&nbsp;central bank. Sovereign Wealth Funds are special
          purpose investment funds or arrangements, owned by the general government. They are a state-owned investment
          fund, derived from a range of sources, e.g. trade surpluses, bank reserves to provide benefit to the host
          country. They are ways for countries to invest excess money rather than store it in a central bank so as to
          accrue profit for the nation’s economy and its citizens. Many are held as bonds and are increasingly
          interested in emerging and or high-growth sectors like low-carbon infrastructure. </p>

        <p>While Sovereign Wealth Funds have existed for over 100 years, their profile has risen considerably over the
          past 30 years. The substantial size and high liquidity of Sovereign Wealth Funds assets has turned the
          government sector into an important international investor group. The global fund management industry is
          consolidating into major financial centres where it can create economies of scale around sophisticated
          information systems and deep pools of skilled professionals. </p>

        <p>Sovereign Wealth Funds are increasingly opening international offices in order to be closer to the markets in
          which they operate in and expand their investment opportunities. London and other cities in the UK are well
          placed to continue to benefit from these trends.</p>

        <p>The substantial size and high liquidity of Sovereign Wealth Funds’ assets have turned the government sector
          into an important international investor group, and these funds are an increasingly important source of global
          capital.</p>

        <p>Sovereign Wealth Funds typically adopt a long-term approach to investing. In the current low-yield
          environment, some Sovereign Wealth Funds are looking to new industries and asset classes in emerging and
          developed markets to generate higher returns and diversify portfolios.</p>

        <p>Some Sovereign Wealth Funds are increasingly interested in emerging and or high-growth sectors like
          low-carbon infrastructure. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues are of particular and growing
          importance and interest to Sovereign Wealth Funds </p>

        <p> Sovereign Wealth Funds also engage in direct investments and are increasingly participating in
          co-investments with private equity funds, pension funds and specialist advisers, although the percentage of
          asset allocation in SWFs’ direct investments has trended downwards in recent years. </p>

        <p>The UK is one of the largest and most open markets in the world for fund management. The reputation of the UK
          as a leading international centre for fund management is built on a number of factors, including: the openness
          of the UK to foreign business, the safe and stable regulatory environment, the network effects associated with
          the cluster of financial and related professional services, a broad skills base, the pivotal international
          position of English law, and the availability of specialist expertise in investments. London in particular is
          an important centre for Sovereign Wealth Funds as a clearing house and location from which some of these funds
          are managed. </p>

        <p>The UK is an important destination for foreign investment generally, and SWF investment in particular. This
          means that SWFs can potentially play an important role in the UK’s post-pandemic economic rebuilding.</p>

        <p>A new National Infrastructure bank was just recently launched on the 17th June 2021 . The bank will launch
          with £12bn in capitalisation and aims to attract up to £40bn of private investment into green projects.
          Currently, the Bank will be able to issue loans, equity, or guarantees to private projects. The Bank will
          start lending to local authorities later in the summer. (HM Treasury, 2021)</p>

        <p>The infrastructure bank offers financing to local and mayoral authorities across the UK, for high-value and
          complex economic infrastructure projects.</p>

        <p>The investment will be focused solely on infrastructure assets or networks, or on new technology.&nbsp;The
          National Infrastructure Bank will prioritise projects where there has tended to be an undersupply of private
          sector financing.&nbsp; This will include those deemed too risky for private investment, such as those
          involving small start-ups or new technologies.</p>

        <p>There is currently not a lot of detail on how the loans will work at this point as they are relatively new.

        <p>Salix Finance are a non-departmental public body owned by the government which provides interest-free
          government-backed loans to the public sector for projects which improve energy efficiency, reduce carbon
          emissions and lower energy bills.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="customfield_12999">
        <p>Public loans are an important source of financing for a local authority given that is usually characterized
          by low interests or, in some cases, they can even be interest-free.</p>

        <p>They provide loans through two main programmes:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Salix Energy Efficient Loans Scheme - In this scheme, the money saved through energy efficiency measures
            (new boiler, lighting, appliances, etc. with improved efficiency) is used to pay back the loan.</li>
          <li>Recycling Loan: Funding from Salix matched by the organisation. Savings from energy efficiency are paid
            back into the loan (hence “recycling”) for further energy efficiency projects.</li>
        </ol>


        <p>Note that in 1st April 2021 the Salix Energy Efficiency Loan Scheme was replaced by the Public Sector
          Decarbonisation Scheme (PSDS).</p>

          <li>Match Funding:</li>
          <li>Security:</li>
        </ul>




        <p>The PSDS is run is a series of Phases with the applications to the first phase closing to new applications on
          11 January 2021 and projects run until 30 September 2021. Phase 2 opened on 7 April 2021 and closed to
          applications on 13 April 2021. The different phases often have different focuses and available funds. Phase 1
          made available £1 billion in grants as part of the Chancellor’s ‘Plan for Jobs 2020’ and phase 2 had a greater
          focus on decarbonisation of heat and provided £75 million. </p>

        <p>For phase 2 the applications were closed as they had submissions which summed to more than twice the
          available funds. Hence Salix funds are quite competitive. The Phase 2 PSDS scheme offered grants of up to a
          maximum of £5m per application for projects that reduce non-traded emissions. </p>

        <p>For the recycling loan, on average, projects have realised a payback of 3.7 years, and the size of the fund
          ranges from £100,000 to over £1 million. A typical fund size would be £500,000 with Salix providing £250,000
          and the client match funding the other half. Salix publishes a quarterly report for the Recycling Fund called
          ‘The Salix League’ a series of league tables that focus on seven delivery measures across all Recycling Fund
          clients, including ‘Spend Rate’ and ‘Use of Available Funds’.</p>

        <h3><a name="EligibilityCriteria"></a>Eligibility Criteria </h3>

        <ul>
          <li>The PSDS is open to a wide range of public sector bodies</li>
          <li>Each phase has specific deadlines and projects must be submitted prior to the deadlines.</li>
          <li>There is no minimum or maximum grant value, and eligible bodies can apply for 100% funding.</li>
          <li>Any energy savings resulting from projects funded by the Grant Scheme should benefit the eligible body.
            Eligible technologies that do not have direct financial or carbon savings are exempt from this requirement.
          </li>
          <li>Salix will prioritise assessing and approving funding for projects that have an early completion date.
            Project delivery must then align with this completion date to remain compliant.</li>
          <li>There are four eligible criteria (although may be phase dependent): heat decarbonisation, energy reduction
            (BMS, cooling, improved efficiency appliances, insulation, etc. ), heat decarbonisation enablers (storage,
            metering, etc.), and not low carbon heating but at least reduce higher carbon alternatives (e.g. coal) See

          <li>The cost to save a tonne of carbon (CO₂e) over the lifetime of the project must be no more than £500.</li>
          <li>The Grant Scheme is primarily for capital works, however external consultancy and management fees may be
            included.</li>
          <li>The measures concerned are not required to be installed by law (including building or health and safety
            legislation)</li>
          <li>The measures are not being installed with a view to commercial gain (other than the reduction of costs
            through increased energy efficiency).</li>
          <li>Installation of the measures concerned have not begun.</li>
          <li>Funding for the project has not been agreed via another source</li>
          <li>In Salix’s reasonable opinion, the project would not take place without the grant.</li>
          <li>There is other guidance which may be specific to the phase, these can be found in the guidance notes</li>
        </ul>


        <p>&nbsp;In general, however, in order to qualify for a Salix loan, a project must have a short payback period
          and represent good value for money in terms of carbon savings.</p>

        <p>One of the main sources of prudential borrowing is through the Public Works Loan Board (PWLB) </p>

        <p>The PWLB lending facility is operated by the UK Debt Management Office on behalf of HM Treasury to provide
          low-cost loans for mainly capital projects such as to build, add or improve capital assets. Prior to&nbsp;25
          February&nbsp;2020 PWLB loans were provided by the Public Works Loan Commissioners. Under prudential regime,
          local authorities are free to finance capital projects by borrowing, provided they can afford to service their
          debts out of their revenues. Local authorities are free to borrow so long as the finance director is satisfied
          that they are acting in line with statute and can afford to repay the loan. (United Kingdom Debt Management
          Office, 2020)</p>
      </td>
      <td class="customfield_12982">

        <p>There are two types of loans</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed rate loans - interest fixed for the life and interest paid at half-yearly intervals. These can be
            paid back according to three different methods:
            <ul>
              <li>Annuity or Equal repayments - fixed half yearly payments of interest and principle.</li>
              <li>Equal instalments of Principal: equal half-yearly instalments of principal together with interest on
                the outstanding balance.</li>
              <li>Maturity: half-yearly payments of interest only with a single repayment of principal at the end of the
                term.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Variable rate loans -rate of interest is variable at one, three or six month intervals (choice of the
            borrower). These are repayable with two different methods:
            <ul>
              <li>Equal instalments of Principal: equal monthly, quarterly or half-yearly instalments of principal
                together with interest on the balance outstanding at the time.</li>
              <li>Maturity: monthly, quarterly or half-yearly payments of interest only with a single repayment of
                principal at the end of the term.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <h2><a name="EligibilityCriteria"></a>Eligibility Criteria</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>For major local authorities (e.g. metropolitan, borough, county, city and combined authorities).</li>
          <li>PWLB is a non-discretionary lender: it does not ask the purpose of a loan, as this would duplicate the
            decision-making structures of the individual local authorities.</li>
          <li>In deciding how much debt is affordable, major local authorities are required by law to "have regard" to
            the Prudential Code, published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA), but
            have discretion to decide how to fulfil this statutory requirement. (CIPFA, 2017)
            <ul>
              <li>The Prudential Code requires authorities to look at capital expenditure and investment plans in the
                light of overall organisational strategy and resources and ensure that decisions are being made with
                sufficient regard to the long run financing implications and potential risks to the authority.</li>
              <li>The LA is required to have regard for several matters, including value for money, affordability,
                practicality etc.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The affordability of borrowing from the PWLB is subject to some of the same risks as other borrowing, for
          example, changing interest rates. The increase in interest rates by 1% in 2019 increased the revenue costs of
          borrowing which meant some project where no longer viable. (Local Government Association, 2020)</p>

        <p>Public loans which are available to Local Authorities. Local authorities are required by regulation to have
          regard to the Prudential Code when carrying out their duties in England and Wales under Part 1 of the Local
          Government Act 2003, in Scotland under Part 7 of the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003, and in Northern
          Ireland under Part 1 of the Local Government Finance Act (Northern Ireland) 2011. (CIPFA, 2017)</p>

        <p>The Government agrees that borrowing primarily for yield is an inappropriate use of the PWLB and in November
          2020 revised its lending terms. Its stated aim was “to develop a proportionate and equitable way to prevent
          local authorities from using PWLB loans to buy commercial assets primarily for yield, without impeding their
          ability to pursue service delivery, housing, and regeneration under the prudential regime as they do now.”
          According to the new lending terms, finance directors must now confirm that “there is no intention to buy
          investment assets primarily for yield at any point in the next three years.”.&nbsp;At the same time, though,
          in evidence to our inquiry, the Minister was clear that the Government still thought commercial investment
          could be “appropriate and necessary when it is done well.” (House of Commons, 2021)</p>

        <h3><a name="SalixandPWLB"></a>Salix and PWLB</h3>

        <p>Two of the most available public loans for local authorities are the <b>Public Works Loan Board (PWLB)</b>
          and <b>Salix Loans.</b> </p>

        <h3><a name="NationalInfrastructureBank"></a>National Infrastructure Bank</h3>

        <p>A new National Infrastructure bank was just recently launched on the 17th June 2021<a
            href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-infrastructure-bank-opens-for-business" title="smart-link"
            class="external-link"
            rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-infrastructure-bank-opens-for-business</a> .
          The bank will launch with £12bn in capitalisation and aims to attract up to £40bn of private investment into
          green projects. Currently, the Bank will be able to issue loans, equity, or guarantees to private projects.
          The Bank will start lending to local authorities later in the summer.</p>

        <p>The investment will be focused solely on infrastructure assets or networks, or on new technology.&nbsp;The
          National Infrastructure Bank will prioritise projects where there has tended to be an undersupply of private
          sector financing.&nbsp; This will include those deemed too risky for private investment, such as those
          involving small startups or new technologies. <a
            href="https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-9717185/What-National-Infrastructure-Bank.html"

        </p>

        <p>There is currently not a lot of detail on how the loans will work at this point as they are relatively new
          and there is no lending to LAs until later in the summer.</p>

        <h3><a name="TaxIncrementFinancing%C2%A0%28TIF%29"></a>Tax Increment Financing&nbsp;(TIF) </h3>

        <p>Permits Local Authorities to borrow money for infrastructure projects against the anticipated increase in tax
          receipts resulting from the infrastructure – for example, Local Authorities might borrow against their income
          within the&nbsp;Business Rate Retention Scheme&nbsp;or against the rate within a specific geographical area
          such as an&nbsp;Enterprise Zone.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Under the first TIF option, local authorities would borrow against their income within the Business Rate
          Retention Scheme. Under the second option, local authorities would be able to borrow against the business
          rates revenue in specific geographical areas (such as Enterprise Zones) in which they would retain 100% of the
          growth in revenue. TIF has not featured in Government documentation in the late 2010s and early 2020s. It was
          referenced briefly in the 2020 Freeports bidding prospectus. Some of the funding for the extension of the
          Northern Line, on the London Underground, to Battersea and Nine Elms came from a TIF structure. The Scottish
          Futures Trust manages a number of TIF schemes, in locations including North Lanarkshire, Leith, Glasgow, Oban,
          Falkirk and Fife. (House of Commons Library, 2021)</p>

          projects that can be completed within the funding timeline, it is difficult to use grant funding to develop
          projects that fit within long-term Net Zero strategies.</p>

        <p>The competitive nature of grant funding does not promote collaboration between LAs to find synergies and cost
          savings. LAs must compete to win funding for projects that fit the scope of the funding call. This combative
          approach does not encourage discussion and open collaboration to find ways to create economies of scale – for
          example, procuring EV charge point installations together. From a private investor perspective, the
          competitive funding landscape is discouraging as the lack of collaboration prohibits the scaling of Net Zero
          projects to create a larger pipeline for investment.</p>

        <p>Municipal bonds can offer councils more control over their debt and are a good way to raise money for local
          infrastructure. The UK Municipal Bonds Agency provides support and documentation for issuing municipal bonds.
          However, only councils scoring “A” or higher (credit score) will be eligible to borrow through the UKMBA’s
          proportionally guaranteed bond issues.</p>

        <p>A municipal bond raises money in the bond market through the issuance of bonds. These are issued by local
          authorities to&nbsp;raise money to pay for local capital&nbsp;programmes such as infrastructure projects,
          maintenance of roads, and&nbsp;the&nbsp;construction and&nbsp;upkeep of&nbsp;council properties by local
          authorities.</p>

        <p>The local authority borrows money from an investor for a defined period of time at a set interest rate, as
          you would do with a personal loan. It pays interest to the investor, typically every six months, for the
          duration of the term, until the investment that was borrowed has been paid off in full.</p>

        <p>Unlike the PWLB, which can suddenly raise interest rates without warning the rates offered by municipal bonds
          are determined by the financial markets, so they are not susceptible to non-market (political) fluctuations.
          This means local authorities have more control over their debt and are protected from PWLB changes.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The UK Municipal Bonds Agency has three lending programmes: (Municipal Bonds Agency, 2021)</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Proportionally guaranteed, pooled loans of £1 million or more for maturities greater than one year.</li>
          <li>Standalone loans to a single local authority for £250 million or more for maturities greater than one
            year.&nbsp; These loans are outside of the proportional guarantee and are guaranteed solely by the borrower,
            who must obtain an external credit rating from one or more of the major credit rating agencies.</li>
          <li>Short term, pooled loans, outside of the proportional guarantee for maturities of less than one year.”
          </li>
        </ul>


        <p>&nbsp;Recently The Green Finance Institute and Abundance Investment, supported
          by&nbsp;<b>UK100</b>,&nbsp;<b>Local Partnerships</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>Innovate UK</b>, launched Local Climate
          Bonds (Green Finance Institute, 2021)</p>

        <h3><a name="Keybenefits"></a>Key benefits</h3>

        <p>The key benefits of municipal bonds to local authorities are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Savings due to lower interest rates</li>
          <li>Protection from changes to the PWLB’s terms and conditions and diversified funding sources</li>
          <li>Fully transparent pricing</li>
          <li>Tailored products to suit local authorities’ needs</li>
          <li>Economies of scale thereby reducing costs</li>

        <h3><a name="Equitycrowdfunding"></a>Equity crowdfunding</h3>

        <p>Sale of a stake in a business to a number of investors in return for investment. The idea is similar to how

        <p>Local authorities can borrow money for any purpose relevant to its function or for the purposes of the
          prudent management of its financial affairs from any source as long as the finance is calculated to
          facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of the local authorities functions. Loans
          provide organisations with revenue or capital to continue its daily operations or any other capital needs that
          it may have. The loans are generally backed by the company's inventory, property, equipment, or real estate,
          as collateral. </p>

        <p>Private providers of loans have a wide range of products available and some of these may be suitable for some
          local authority circumstances. Private finance has additional risks around repayment, timelines and ethical
          considerations that must be considered in choose this route. </p>

        <p>There are investors who can provide products based on ethical-social principles. </p>

        <p>There is some mismatch between the way local authorities traditionally deliver projects and needs of private
          investment . Investors have shorter timescales to make decisions and cannot always align with the decision
          making process within local authorities.</p>

        <p>✅ Investors need to see what the timeline for a project or programme is, along with a clear view of at what
          stage the project is from a budget, buy in and decision standpoint. eg. Does the project have sign off from
          the financial director?</p>

        <p>✅ The benefits and aims of a project need to be clearly communicated, along with success descriptions in a
          simple way</p>

        <p>✅ A consistent financial model with its assumptions clearly laid out should be available</p>

        <p>✅ Investors would like to interact with an intelligent customer, so make sure the project team understand the
          project scope, its potential financing and business model.</p>

        <p>✅ Be clear who the primary contact is. Investors do not want to spend time tracking down the right person to
          talk to.</p>

        <p>✅ A clear desciption of the potential risks and rewards of the project, including political risks from
          stakeholders both internal and external.</p>

        <p>A revolving fund (or recycling fund) is a fund set up for specified purposes with the concept that repayments
          to the fund may be used again for these purposes. They can help secure long-term finance for investment.</p>

        <p>✅ Once implemented, a revolving fund model can be self-sustaining, with the repayments can be utilised to
          finance additional projects. A revolving fund can build market capacity without a fiscal year limitation that
          can create unrealistic programme timescales and milestones.</p>

        <p>✅ Revolving funds might provide a solution for locations where there is an underdeveloped public/municipal
          credit market, when there is a credible and capable fund manager and the ability to enter into multi-year
          contracts.</p>

        <p>❌ Recovering operating costs in early years can be difficult and could make repayment periods may be long
          (typically 5–8 years or even more). The Fund may vary from year to year, due to financial sources mobilized
          and the return of investments.</p>

        <h3><a name="Example"></a>Example</h3>

        <p>The Salix Recycling Fund aims to increase capital investment in energy-efficient technologies across the
          public sector. It is a ring-fenced fund with capital provided by Salix and matched by the partner
          organisation, to be spent on energy-saving projects with paybacks up to 10 years. The financial savings
          delivered by the projects are returned to the fund allowing further spending on front line services, hence the
          term ‘Recycling Fund’. (SALIX, 2021)</p>

        <p>Design Contests are most used when a local authority does not have a defined idea for the desired outcome or
          design of the solution. It is particularly common for architectural projects, or in general when a creative
          solution is needed. A Competition is carried out with a jury with an open call for entry published. </p>

        <p><b>What is a Design Contest for:</b> This procurement route is most used when a local authority does not have
          a defined idea for the desired outcome or design of the solution. It is particularly common for architectural
          projects, or in general when a creative solution is needed. </p>

        <p><b>Timescale:</b> A design contest takes typically 5-7 weeks</p>

        <p><b>Legislation</b>: In England, Wales and Northern Ireland these are provided under the Public Contract
          Regulations 2015 (the regulations). In Scotland they are provided under Public Contracts Regulations
          (Scotland) 2012 (Design Contests are in Part 6)</p>

        <p><b>Design contests</b> allow the contracting authority to acquire, mainly in the fields of town and country
          planning, architecture, engineering or data processing, a plan or design selected by a jury after being put
          out to competition. Design contests either can be part of a procedure leading to the award of a public service
          contract or can involve prizes or payments to participants. - (Government of United Kingdom. (2020))</p>

        <p><b>Design Contests</b> can be used to improve dialogue and choice, drive up quality, and incentivise
          creativity and innovation while generating a range of ideas. They can offer all parties - clients,
          stakeholders, competitors and end users - the opportunity to expand options, challenge presumptions and engage
          with empathies, generating distinguished and appropriate resolutions. They can improve market competition and
          access, and that, in turn, exposes emerging talent, giving opportunity to unthought-of, original and
          innovative approaches. They are as suited for commissioning one-off projects, simpler humbler works and
          background development, as they are for more prestigious projects such as civic buildings, infrastructure
          designs - such as bridges, and public realm works. They may also be used to select individual consultants or
          multi- disciplinary teams. (Menteth, W. et al. (2015))</p>

        <p>✅ Good design is prioritised and high quality is brought to a project. </p>

        <p>✅ They can engage the public</p>

        <p>✅ They can offer speed, efficiency and flexibility in procurement. </p>

        <p>✅ They are adaptable, scalable and ideal for all types and sizes of project.</p>

        <h2><a name="Thedesigncontestisbestusedwhere%3A"></a>The design contest is best used where:</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>The Local Authority is not sure about what is possible to meet the outcomes and requirements</li>

          <li>The Local Authority wants to engage with emerging approaches and suppliers</li>

        <p>Framework agreements and dynamic purchase systems (DPS) are the preferred commercial purchasing tools for
          local authorities procuring products, works, services. Utilisation of existing frameworks and DPSs which meet
          project requirements can help speed up the procurement process which is often one of the major bottlenecks of
          local energy projects. This page describes frameworks and DPSs in more detail and some of their differences,
          advantages and disadvantages. </p>
      </td>
      <td class="customfield_12982">
        <p>Framework agreements and DPS are not procurement procedures but commercial purchasing tools. These are,
          indeed, agreements between one or multiple local authorities and one or multiple suppliers. Frameworks and
          DPS’s should be the preferred commercial purchasing tool whenever a local authority is procuring off-the-shelf
          products, works, or services that are generally available on the market. In these cases, it is advisable to
          search for an existing framework or DPS that can meet the requirement of the project, before considering other
          procurement routes. Developing Frameworks and Dynamic Purchase Systems is a complicated and time consuming
          process and hence finding suitable existing contracts is very advantageous to speed up the procurement
          process. Note that any public procurement should follow the basic rules and principles of procurement (Local
          Government Association, 2017; UK Government, 2022; Cabinet Office, 2020). The following sections go into more
          details about each of these types of contracts, their key features, as well as some advantages and
          disadvantages. </p>

        <p>It is worth noting that there is specific languages and terms around procurement and hence it may be useful
          to consult glossaries e.g. (London Borough of Richmond Upon Thames, 2012) [<a
            href="https://www.richmond.gov.uk/media/22653/glossary_of_procurement_terminology.pdf" class="external-link"

        <h1><a name="FrameworkAgreements"></a>Framework Agreements</h1>

        <h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>

        <p>Frameworks are umbrella agreements between one or more contracting authorities which determines the terms and
          conditions for e.g. price, and quantity, for contracts to be awarded during a given period. They effectively
          produce a list of approved suppliers for the buyer who applied as part of the tendering process. The minimum
          number of suppliers required on a framework is two, down from three in previous years <a
            href="https://www.local.gov.uk/national-procurement-strategy/pcr-toolkit-2015/how-should-we-use-technology/framework-agreement"
            class="external-link"
            rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.local.gov.uk/national-procurement-strategy/pcr-toolkit-2015/how-should-we-use-technology/framework-agreement</a>
          . </p>

        <p>Frameworks are often used when buyers/providers have a need for particular products or services but there is
          an uncertainty over specifics of the scope or the time period if will be required. A framework significantly
          reduces the requirement of going through the tender process every time a job or service is required. The
          length of a framework is up to a maximum of four years and when established no new providers can be added to
          the framework during this period. </p>

        <p>Frameworks are often split into individual lots, which are combinations of components of the contract for
          specific goods and services. A prospective supplier may have to apply separate tender responses to each lot
          that they are interested. Once a framework is passed, individual contracts, called call-offs are awarded
          throughout the project whenever a particular service or work is required. There are several processes through
          which a contract can be awarded. One such procedure are mini-competitions, this is where suppliers quote
          prices for specific jobs with the cheapest quote being offered the job. This is often useful if it is
          difficult to directly identify a supplier who can offer the best value you for money. This can take 4-6 weeks
          to appoint a provider. Alternatively, contracts can be offered based on the highest scoring supplier during
          the tendering process receives the work. If they cannot deliver it is offered to the second highest scoring
          and so on until a supplier can deliver the work. </p>

        <h2><a name="AdvantagesofFrameworksAgreements"></a><b>Advantages of Frameworks Agreements</b></h2>

        <p>There are several advantages to both suppliers and buyers from framework agreements:</p>

        <p><b>For Suppliers</b></p>

        <p>✅ There is a possibility of being awarded multiple contracts from the same framework.</p>

        <p>✅ They can help build the reputation of your business.</p>

        <p>✅ There is a chance to build new working relationships and networks with multiple buyers.</p>

        <p>✅ Reduces tendering costs.</p>

        <p><b>For Buyers</b></p>

        <p>✅ Less downtime between identifying a need and fulfilling it.</p>

        <p>✅ Increased network of potential buyers.</p>

        <p>✅ Reduction in costs and inefficiencies from publishing multiple contracts for different goods and services.
        </p>

        <p>✅ Potential savings with economies of scale.</p>

        <h2><a name="DisadvantagesofFrameworksAgreements"></a><b>Disadvantages of Frameworks Agreements</b></h2>

        <p><b>For Suppliers</b><br>
          ❌ Applying for a framework may require a lot of work and there is no guarantee that you will be selected as a
          provider. </p>

        <p>❌ Even if you are successful in becoming an approved supplier on a framework, there is no guarantee you will
          be selected for any of the call-offs.</p>

        <p>❌ Unsuccessful suppliers are unable to apply to any of the call-offs throughout the agreement period. </p>

        <p><b>For Buyers</b></p>

        <p>❌ Frameworks are very complicated and so need to be well designed to be used properly. Proper due diligence
          is required in selecting or choosing a framework, see here <b>[</b><a
            href="https://esc-dev-jira-01.atlassian.net/browse/LETP-558" class="external-link"
            rel="nofollow noreferrer"><b>https://esc-dev-jira-01.atlassian.net/browse/LETP-558</b></a> <b>].</b></p>

        <p>❌ There are gaps in the market for energy projects, especially for singe technologies. Hence there may not be
          suitable frameworks for your needs. </p>

        <p>❌ They may not always reduce the amount of procurement effort. </p>

        <p>❌ Time saved in tendering generic work does not always translate to the best outcomes. </p>

        <p>❌ Care is needed to avoid duplication and over-complication. </p>

        <p>❌ Since frameworks are closed off for the duration of the contract, new suppliers with new solutions can not
          be included.</p>

        <h1><a name="DynamicPurchaseSystems%28DPS%29"></a>Dynamic Purchase Systems (DPS)</h1>

        <p>When there is a recurring requirement for a product, work or service a DPS is likely to be the most
          appropriate purchasing tool for a buyer. DPS are used for good services and works and are similar to
          frameworks but with the main differences being that new suppliers may join at any point during the duration of
          the notice. In addition, they are to be run as completely electronic process and the application process is
          simpler than that of a framework. DPSs are restricted procedures which mean they are split into two stages, a
          selection stage and awarding stage. The selection stage is open to any providers which meet the selection
          criteria and can be used to select and filter the initial applicants. In the award stage, all those selected
          in the first stage are invited to bid on the specific contract being advertised. Although originally there was
          a time limit of four years for a DPS these no longer apply.</p>

        <p>Since there are no limits on the number of suppliers who may join a DPS this provides a large array of
          resources for the buyer, and when specific contracts are to be awarded the buyer invites anyone on the DPS to
          bid. This procedure can streamline the procurement process ensuring that buyers can quickly award contracts to
          appropriate suppliers. Since a DPS also allows new suppliers, then unlike a framework agreement, new solutions
          or new market players can join to refresh the pool of resources. The procedure for Dynamic Purchasing Systems
          are shown in Figure 1 below.</p>

        <h2><a name="AdvantagesofDynamicPurchaseSystems"></a><b>Advantages of Dynamic Purchase Systems</b> </h2>

        <p>✅ It enables new entrants into the market and ultimately inclusion onto any DPS arrangement (subject to
          satisfying qualification criteria) which also can offset instability of losing suppliers and increases
          competition.</p>

        <p>✅ Once live suppliers can apply at any time once the DPS during the lifetime of the contract, unlike a closed
          framework arrangement. Thus re-application is possible.</p>

        <p>✅ The procurement process is more streamlined for both buyers and suppliers, which in particular may help new
          and/or smaller providers including small and medium enterprises. In particular there is a simplified
          application process for suppliers to apply to be on a DPS.</p>

        <p>✅ They may provide cost savings to buyers through increased competition of suppliers. </p>

        <p>✅ Some DPSs can be divided into work stream categories and&nbsp;geographical locations​ helping support local
          businesses.</p>

        <p>✅ There is no limit on the number of providers allowed onto a DPS and hence buyers can select from a large
          group of suppliers. </p>

        <p>✅ They provide an opportunity to stimulate markets. </p>

        <p>✅ There are no restrictions on the duration of a DPS. </p>

        <h2><a name="DisadvantagesofDynamicPurchaseSystems"></a><b>Disadvantages of Dynamic Purchase Systems</b></h2>

        <p>❌ Since there is a potentially large pool of suppliers then there is more competition and therefore reduced
          chance of being chosen for a contract. Of course this may be a positive for the buyer.</p>

        <p>❌ As with framework agreement, being an approved supplier on a DPS doesn’t guarantee you will awarded any
          work. </p>

        <p>❌ Although DPSs help simplify the procurement process, putting together a new DPS is a very complicated and
          drawnout process to design and put together. </p>

        <p>❌ For those administrating the DPS there could be a large amount of work to managing the supplier and
          stakeholder engagement (Local Government Association, 2017).</p>

        <p>❌ DPSs cannot be used for direct awards since the tendering stage is the only stage where a decision can be
          made for value-for-money for each individual requirement (Crown Commercial Service, 2016). </p>

        <p>The primary outcome of this section is to provide a decision-making framework that will support the
          assessment of the impact that a project is expected to have on a local area. This content is not meant to be
          used to assess the potential benefits and risks associated with a net-zero strategy or action plan but as a
          tool to evaluate an individual project. This evaluation should ideally be reviewed at each stage of the plan
          of work.</p>
      </td>
      <td class="customfield_12999">
        <p>This self-assessment framework has been developed following the theory of Doughnut Economics. &nbsp;Doughnut
          Economics takes into account the social and ecological impact of human activities while developing strategic
          aims or projects or programmes.</p>

        <p>In answering the questions included in each subsection, the user will need to engage with internal
          stakeholders spread across their organisation, stimulating a discussion on the social and environmental impact
          of a specific project.</p>

        <p>As an outcome, the user will be able to communicate to internal and external stakeholders the social and
          ecological benefits of the project, as well as its risks.</p>

      <td class="customfield_12982">
        <p>As part of the insights for local authority transformation of the UK energy system to meet carbon reduction
          targets, decision-making support was highlighted as a requirement for the Smart Local Energy Toolkit.</p>

        <p>One of the output tools for Net Zero Go is the Decision Making Doughnut, which will complement local
          authority decision-making processes by:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Providing a visual summary of the impact of a given project</li>
          <li>Enforcing decision-makers to consider aspects such as the impact of decisions/projects on the wider
            environment</li>
          <li>Quantifying the impact of a given project on a relative scale allows decision-makers to observe impacts at
            a glance for consideration</li>
          <li>Embedded environmental/carbon thinking for non-energy specific projects</li>
        </ul>


        <p>While this decision-making tool could be used at any stage during the lifecycle of a local authority’s
          projects or processes, it is recommended that the tool is primarily used at project initiation, in Stage 0:
          strategic definition stage. This is because communicating the impacts of a given project earlier allows them
          to be understood by interested stakeholders, therefore reducing the risk of progress being blocked further
          down the process.</p>

        <p>During the Plan of Work process, any changes made to the project should be reflected in an updated version of
          the Decision Making Doughnut to keep it relevant and applicable.</p>

        <p>This decision-making wheel is based on the Doughnut Economics model, which is a visual framework for
          sustainable development that combines planetary/environmental boundaries with social boundaries. These
          concepts of boundaries are arranged in a doughnut shape: the inner circle represents the social boundary that
          relates to life’s essentials, and the outer layer of the doughnut represents the planetary/environmental
          ceilings that life depends on, which therefore should not be breached.</p>

        <p>In the context of local authority decision making, the slices of the doughnut have been modified to represent
          local authority issues.</p>

        <h2><a name="Limitationsofthetool"></a>Limitations of the tool</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>This decision-making support provides only a snapshot in time of a given project and therefore future
            unexpected effects may not be accounted for.</li>
          <li>This tool will be best associated with a local authority’s current baseline view of all activities to
            understand how decisions made around projects may shift away from or towards Net Zero goals.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2><a name="Impactratingdefinitions"></a>Impact rating definitions</h2>

        <p>The Doughnut Economics Tool contains two impact categories</p>

        <ul>
          <li>social Boundaries</li>
          <li>planetary/environmental boundaries</li>
        </ul>


        <p>These 2 impact macro-categories contain respectively 14 and 10 subsections. Each subsection contains between
          2 and 6 questions to support a self-assessment of the expected impact of the project.</p>

        <p>To answer each of the questions required for the sections of the doughnut, you may need to consult key
          stakeholders from different departments, and evidence to support the score ranking will be required.</p>

        <h2><a name="UsingCPVCodes"></a>Using CPV Codes</h2>

        <p>Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) codes are an effective methods for finding appropriate contracts. The CPV
          code system establishes a single nine digit classification system for public procurement to describe
          divisions, groups, classes and categories for supplies, works or services <a
            href="https://simap.ted.europa.eu/web/simap/cpv" class="external-link"
            rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://simap.ted.europa.eu/web/simap/cpv</a>. </p>

        <p>The following are examples of some CPV codes</p>

        <ul>
          <li>09000000-3 - Petroleum products, fuel, electricity and other sources of energy</li>
          <li>31000000-6 - Electrical machinery, apparatus, equipment and consumables; lighting</li>
          <li>34000000-7 - Transport equipment and auxiliary products to transportation</li>
          <li>51000000-9 - Installation services (except software)</li>
        </ul>


        <p>These codes are included in various sections of advertised procurement contracts. Typically there is a main
          CPV for the entire contract, and then additional/supplementary CPV codes also included. Each lot may also have
          its own CPV code. </p>

          <div class="panelContent" style="background-color: #deebff;">
            <p>Note that CPV codes are defined by EU procurement regulations. It is possible that as time goes on the UK
              will develop an alternative coding system for public procurements.</p>

        <h1><a name="ChoosinganappropriateofframeworkagreementorDynamicPurchasingSystem%28DPS%29"></a>Choosing an
          appropriate of framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS)</h1>

        <p>Once frameworks or Dynamic Purchasing Systems have been identified, via the framework search tool, or
          otherwise, there is a number of areas that should be considered before deciding whether the framework or DPS
          is suitable for you energy project. The following are important questions to try and answer:</p>

        <p><b>Does the&nbsp;framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS)&nbsp;scope cover&nbsp;your
            entire&nbsp;requirement?</b></p>

        <p>✅ Any framework or DPS will be limited in what services or products it can offer. Potential users should be
          clear about what they are looking to procure and be robust as to whether a chosen framework can provide it.
          There may be opportunities to change project scope or use multiple frameworks to deliver, although there are
          obviously project impacts of these choices.</p>

        <p><b>What is the framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) expiration&nbsp;date?</b></p>

        <p>✅ Frameworks have end dates. This is not quite so important with DPS as they may be self refreshing. Aligning
          a project procurement needs with the active period of a framework is vital. Risks of delays or slippage within
          the project should also be considered when assessing this.</p>

        <p><b>What are the call-off methods for the framework agreement in questions?</b></p>

        <p>✅ How can you use the framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS). Does the method of call off/
          mini tender/ selection align with your project timescales and needs.</p>

        <p><b>Who owns&nbsp;the&nbsp;framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS)&nbsp;and how&nbsp;robust
            are&nbsp;they?</b></p>

        <p>✅ Potential users should assess the framework owner (e.g. how financially robust are they (balance sheet)?).
          Who are they owned by? Do they have shareholders?)</p>

        <p><b>Do the&nbsp;framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS)&nbsp;terms and&nbsp;conditions
            allow&nbsp;you to contract&nbsp;in your&nbsp;preferred&nbsp;manner?</b></p>

        <p>✅ A local authority should consider things such as contract types available (Design and Build etc), the
          ability to incorporate finance from a contractor, or the ability to allow for innovation.</p>

        <p><b>What&nbsp;support&nbsp;will be&nbsp;provided?</b></p>

        <p>✅ How much of the procurement process is managed or supported by the framework operator? This may impact the
          capacity or capability required within the project team. It may also affect timescales for procurement. Does
          the framework provide support for building your evaluation criteria, for example.</p>

        <p><b>How well is&nbsp;the&nbsp;framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS)&nbsp;managed?</b></p>

        <p>✅ Some frameworks are owned but not managed. Those that are managed may be under capacity constraint. This
          may impact both procurement timelines and potentially quality of responses. (e.g. what support services are
          available? what processes are in place to manage and remove providers? what are the escalation procedures?)
        </p>

        <p><b>How much will&nbsp;the framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System
            (DPS)&nbsp;owner/support&nbsp;partner get paid&nbsp;either directly or&nbsp;indirectly for
            their&nbsp;support and use of&nbsp;the framework?</b></p>

        <p>✅ The cost of procurement will need to be included in the project budget.</p>

        <p><b>Is your&nbsp;selection of a&nbsp;framework/&nbsp;support partner&nbsp;compliant
            with&nbsp;public&nbsp;procurement&nbsp;rules?</b></p>

        <p>✅ Does the framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) align with public procurement rules. This
          should be the case as frameworks are set up to enable public procurement, but it is always better to be sure
          as the liability for breaking procurement rules may lie with the project procurement team.</p>

        <p><b>Is your&nbsp;selection of a&nbsp;framework/&nbsp;support partner&nbsp;compliant with your
            organisation's&nbsp;procurement&nbsp;rules?</b></p>

        <p>✅ Do your own procurement rules allow using a particular framework agreement or Dynamic Purchasing System
          (DPS)?</p>

        <p>The primary goal of Stage 0 is strategic – to confirm that a project is the best means of achieving the
          client requirements.</p>

        <p>Stage 0 focuses on making the right strategic decisions and capturing them in a <b>business case</b>. This
          involves considering the pros and cons, project risks and project budget for a range of options, as well as
          carrying out site and corresponding planning appraisals. The last part of this stage is to undertake a
          comparative analysis and ratify the best option for delivering the requirements.</p>

          📤 Stage Outcome: The best means of achieving project requirements is confirmed.<br>
          👩‍🏫 Who: Only the local authority team is involved at this stage. They may seek advice from a wide range of
          professional advisers to help them develop the requirements and Business Case that will achieve these. The
          Stage 0 team should be very different in composition to the Stage 1 team<br>
          ⚡ The process of developing the project requirements and the corresponding business case should involve all
          the important project stakeholders. Stage 0 should be strategic in nature, defining the business case and
          client requirements.<br>
          ❌ Stage 0 is not about design or the practical details.</p>


        <p>Project risks consider any circumstances that would affect the delivery of the requirements for each option.
          Risks might include the potential for substantive costs, stakeholder constraints that delay the delivery date
          or a costly services diversion that could make an option unviable.</p>


        <p>The budget needed to achieve the requirements will be considered for each option. This will include
          professional fees and, where relevant, land acquisition costs.</p>


        <p>Spatial requirements relevant to any option may need to be determined. These can significantly influence the
          estimated delivery costs.</p>


        <p>Stage 0 is about gleaning feedback from previous similar projects and gathering insight from project
          stakeholders. This makes sure that lessons are learned and incorporated. Knowledge gained in this way can help
          the briefing process and improve design quality.</p>


        <p>Stage 0 should not be regarded only as a first step – it is also the logical next step after Stage 7 in the
          circular Plan of Work process. At the end of an asset’s life, it must be refurbished, repurposed or
          deconstructed. Detailed tasks for Stage 0 need to align with the complexity of the challenge and the diversity
          and demands of the options being considered for the business case</p>
