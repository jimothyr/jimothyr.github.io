    "Summary": "The report considers the electricity market in the UK and the legal framework which separates electricity generation, distribution and supply. It finds that, in spite of inherent difficulties in electricity regulation, local authorities can do much more to generate their own green electricity, support cost-effective supplies to local areas and create new income streams to offset council budget reductions. A further objective that local authorities should consider is to work together to supply energy to the capacity market and gain significant income as a result.",

The main findings they found are:\n•    Informed by scientific evidence, the contribution of local reductions in emissions can be significant and should be actioned as soon as possible.\n•    A cut today is better than the same cut tomorrow and is worth as much as a large cut later. The priority should be to begin cutting emissions as soon as possible, rather than worrying about how to eliminate them altogether.\n•    Councils ‘own operations’ are a good starting point. Progress is being made in reducing the emissions from buildings and assets, preparing residents for a move away from fossil fuel heating systems; in environmental matters from waste and resources to public realm services; in planting trees and land management strategies; and in EV infrastructure and fleet, including hydrogen developments.\n•    By adopting a local leadership role, and taking urgent action on climate change, councils are able to demonstrate to residents some more immediate local benefits, including fuel poverty through greener, cheaper energy, improvements to air quality and public realm.",

Delivering on this agenda within such constraints requires service and operational innovation whilst maintaining the support and trust of local residents, which Local Government Association research has shown to have fallen significantly over the past five years. If Local Authorities are to meet these grand challenges over the coming decade, sourcing competitive capital and working with residents to find solutions will be essential.  At a time when public sector finances are under increasing pressure, crowdfunding – still mistakenly seen as being just another form of charitable giving – has the potential to offer a new model of finance via an investment-based business model that generates social, environmental and economic returns. The report will be of interest to finance, legal, treasury and procurement teams across the UK public sector as innovative and collective solutions are sought to the above challenges.",

    "Summary": "LEAP, the Low Emissions Analysis Platform, is a widely-used software tool for energy policy analysis and climate change mitigation assessment developed at the Stockholm Environment Institute.\n\nLEAP has been adopted by thousands of organizations in more than 190 countries worldwide. Its users include government agencies, academics, non-governmental organizations, consulting companies, and energy utilities. It has been used at many different scales ranging from cities and states to national, regional and global applications.\n\nLEAP is fast becoming the de facto standard for countries undertaking integrated resource planning, greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation assessments, and Low Emission Development Strategies (LEDS) especially in the developing world, and many countries have also chosen to use LEAP as part of their commitment to report to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). At least 32 countries used LEAP to create energy and emissions scenarios that were the basis for their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions on Climate Change (INDCs): the foundation of the historic Paris climate agreement intended to demonstrate the intent of countries to begin decarbonizing their economies and invest in climate-resilience.",
